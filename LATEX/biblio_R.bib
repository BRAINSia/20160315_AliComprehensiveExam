abstract = {This study presents a novel automatic approach for the identification of anatomical brain structures in magnetic resonance images (MRI). The method combines a fast multiscale multi-channel three dimensional (3D) segmentation algorithm providing a rich feature vocabulary together with a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier. The segmentation produces a full hierarchy of segments, expressed by an irregular pyramid with only linear time complexity. The pyramid provides a rich, adaptive representation of the image, enabling detection of various anatomical structures at different scales. A key aspect of the approach is the thorough set of multiscale measures employed throughout the segmentation process which are also provided at its end for clinical analysis. These features include in particular the prior probability knowledge of anatomic structures due to the use of an MRI probabilistic atlas. An SVM classifier is trained based on this set of features to identify the brain structures. We validated the approach using a gold standard real brain MRI data set. Comparison of the results with existing algorithms displays the promise of our approach.},

@article{Anbeek2008,
abstract = {A fully automated method has been developed for segmentation of four different structures in the neonatal brain: white matter (WM), central gray matter (CEGM), cortical gray matter (COGM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The segmentation algorithm is based on information from T2-weighted (T2-w) and inversion recovery (IR) scans. The method uses a K nearest neighbor (KNN) classification technique with features derived from spatial information and voxel intensities. Probabilistic segmentations of each tissue type were generated. By applying thresholds on these probability maps, binary segmentations were obtained. These final segmentations were evaluated by comparison with a gold standard. The sensitivity, specificity, and Dice similarity index (SI) were calculated for quantitative validation of the results. High sensitivity and specificity with respect to the gold standard were reached: sensitivity >0.82 and specificity >0.9 for all tissue types. Tissue volumes were calculated from the binary and probabilistic segmentations. The probabilistic segmentation volumes of all tissue types accurately estimated the gold standard volumes. The KNN approach offers valuable ways for neonatal brain segmentation. The probabilistic outcomes provide a useful tool for accurate volume measurements. The described method is based on routine diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is suitable for large population studies.},

Measurements of spin-lattice (T(1)) and spin-spin (T(2)) magnetic relaxation times were made in six normal tissues in the rat (muscle, kidney, stomach, intestine, brain, and liver) and in two malignant solid tumors, Walker sarcoma and Novikoff hepatoma. Relaxation times for the two malignant tumors were distinctly outside the range of values for the normal tissues studied, an indication that the malignant tissues were characterized by an increase in the motional freedom of tissue water molecules. The possibility of using magnetic relaxation methods for rapid discrimination between benign and malignant surgical specimens has also been considered. Spin-lattice relaxation times for two benign fibroadenomas were distinct from those for both malignant tissues and were the same as those of muscle.},

abstract = {The ability to study changes in brain morphometry in longitudinal studies majorly depends on the accuracy and reproducibility of the brain tissue quantification. We evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of four previously proposed automatic brain tissue segmentation methods: FAST, SPM5, an automatically trained k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, and a conventional kNN classifier based on a prior training set. The intensity nonuniformity correction and skull-stripping mask were the same for all methods. Evaluations were performed on MRI scans of elderly subjects derived from the general population. Accuracy was evaluated by comparison to two manual segmentations of MRI scans of six subjects (mean age 65.9+/-4.4 years). Reproducibility was assessed by comparing the automatic segmentations of 30 subjects (mean age 57.0+/-3.7 years) who were scanned twice within a short time interval. All methods showed good accuracy and reproducibility, with only small differences between methods. The conventional kNN classifier was the most accurate method with similarity indices of 0.82/0.90/0.94 for cerebrospinal fluid/gray matter/white matter, but it showed the lowest reproducibility. FAST yielded the most reproducible segmentation volumes with volume difference standard deviations of 0.55/0.49/0.38 (percentage of intracranial volume) respectively. The results of the reproducibility experiment can be used to calculate the required number of subjects in the design of a longitudinal study with sufficient power to detect changes over time in brain (tissue) volume. Example sample size calculations demonstrate a rather large effect of the choice of segmentation method on the required number of subjects.},

In terms of absolute brain volume measurements US and kNN showed good correlation with the manual segmentations and with each other (all Spearman's correlation coefficients $\rho$0.96; all p<0.001). Concerning brain volume changes, SIENA showed a good ($\rho$=0.82; p=0.004), kNN a moderate ($\rho$=0.60; p=0.067) and US a weak ($\rho$=0.50; p=0.138) correlation with the manual segmentations.

New image features in order to better localize points of correspondence between the two images are introduced as well as a novel approach to generate a dense displacement field based upon the weighted diffusion of automatically derived feature correspondences. An extensive validation of the algorithm was performed on T1-weighted SPGR MR brain images from the NIREP evaluation database.

abstract = {We describe a new method to automatically discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls, based on multidimensional classification of hippocampal shape features. This approach uses spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients to model the shape of the hippocampi, which are segmented from magnetic resonance images (MRI) using a fully automatic method that we previously developed. SPHARM coefficients are used as features in a classification procedure based on support vector machines (SVM). The most relevant features for classification are selected using a bagging strategy. We evaluate the accuracy of our method in a group of 23 patients with AD (10 males, 13 females, age+/-standard-deviation (SD)=73+/-6 years, mini-mental score (MMS)=24.4+/-2.8), 23 patients with amnestic MCI (10 males, 13 females, age+/-SD=74+/-8 years, MMS=27.3+/-1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13 males, 12 females, age+/-SD=64+/-8 years), using leave-one-out cross-validation. For AD vs controls, we obtain a correct classification rate of 94\%, a sensitivity of 96\%, and a specificity of 92\%. For MCI vs controls, we obtain a classification rate of 83\%, a sensitivity of 83\%, and a specificity of 84\%. This accuracy is superior to that of hippocampal volumetry and is comparable to recently published SVM-based whole-brain classification methods, which relied on a different strategy. This new method may become a useful tool to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.},

SVM was originally developed for two-class classification. It is extended to solve multi-class classification problem. In this paper, 57 dimensional feature vectors for MRI image are selected as input for SVM. The segmentation of MRI image based on the Multi-Classification SVM (MCSVM) is investigated.

abstract = {The general inverse problem is characterized by at least one of the following two complications: (1) data can only be computed from the model by means of a numerical algorithm, and (2) the a priori model constraints can only be expressed via numerical algorithms. For linear problems and the so-called 'weakly nonlinear problems', which can be locally approximated by a linear problem, analytical methods can provide estimates of the best fitting model and measures of resolution (nonuniqueness and uncertainty of solutions). This is, however, not possible for general problems. The only way to proceed is to use sampling methods that collect information on the posterior probability density in the model space. One such method is the inverse Monte Carlo strategy for resolution analysis suggested by Mosegaard and Tarantola. This method allows sampling of the posterior probability density even in cases where prior information is only available as an algorithm that samples the prior probability density. Once a collection of models sampled according to the posterior is available, it is possible to estimate, not only posterior model parameter covariances, but also resolution measures that are more useful in many applications. For example, posterior probabilities of the existence of interesting Earth structures like discontinuities and flow patterns can be estimated. These extended possibilities for resolution analysis may also provide new insight into problems that are usually treated by means of analytical methods.},

Obtaining such examples is however very difficult, due to the reduced size and low contrast of plaques.

abstract = {For general purpose image segmentation, it is required to find and integrate the features that best char- acterize the regions to be segmented. This paper proposes a machine learning approach to finding the appropriate features and also a new segmentation method based on the information obtained while learning. Precisely, our method is based on the AdaBoost algorithm for learning the difference between regions, and the CRF-based (conditional random fields) energy formulation for the segmentation using the information from the learning. We have applied our method to interactive (semi-automatic) and unsupervised (fully-automatic) segmentation problems. While the interactive case is relatively straight- forward due to the nature of our machine learning scheme, the unsupervised case is not. Hence, for the unsupervised segmentation, we devise a new initialization method and an EM-like (ExpectationMaxi- mization) optimization method that iterates AdaBoost learning and graph-cuts. The analysis shows that the number of regions is automatically determined so that only distinguishable regions are survived. Experimental results also show that the proposed method gives promising results in diverse applications such as texture segmentation, color-texture segmentation, and page segmentation.},

@article{Loizou2011,
abstract = {This study introduces the use of multiscale amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AM-FM) texture analysis of multiple sclerosis (MS) using magnetic resonance (MR) images from brain. Clinically, there is interest in identifying potential associations between lesion texture and disease progression, and in relating texture features with relevant clinical indexes, such as the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). This longitudinal study explores the application of 2-D AM-FM analysis of brain white matter MS lesions to quantify and monitor disease load. To this end, MS lesions and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) from MS patients, as well as normal white matter (NWM) from healthy volunteers, were segmented on transverse T2-weighted images obtained from serial brain MR imaging (MRI) scans (0 and 6-12 months). The instantaneous amplitude (IA), the magnitude of the instantaneous frequency (IF), and the IF angle were extracted from each segmented region at different scales. The findings suggest that AM-FM characteristics succeed in differentiating 1) between NWM and lesions; 2) between NAWM and lesions; and 3) between NWM and NAWM. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier succeeded in differentiating between patients that, two years after the initial MRI scan, acquired an EDSS ≤ 2 from those with EDSS > 2 (correct classification rate = 86\%). The best classification results were obtained from including the combination of the low-scale IA and IF magnitude with the medium-scale IA. The AM-FM features provide complementary information to classical texture analysis features like the gray-scale median, contrast, and coarseness. The findings of this study provide evidence that AM-FM features may have a potential role as surrogate markers of lesion load in MS.},

We trained our approaches using T1-weighted brain MRIs from 30 subjects 10 normal elderly, 10 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 10 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and tested on an independent set of 40 subjects (20 normal, 20 AD). Manually segmented gold standard hippocampal tracings were available for all subjects (training and testing). We assessed each approach's accuracy relative to manual segmentations, and its power to map AD effects. We then converted the segmentations into parametric surfaces to map disease effects on anatomy. After surface reconstruction, we computed significance maps, and overall corrected p-values, for the 3-D profile of shape differences between AD and normal subjects. Our AdaBoost and Ada-SVM segmentations compared favorably with the manual segmentations and detected disease effects as well as FreeSurfer on the data tested. Cumulative p-value plots, in conjunction with the false discovery rate method, were used to examine the power of each method to detect correlations with diagnosis and cognitive scores. We also evaluated how segmentation accuracy depended on the size of the training set, providing practical information for future users of this technique.},

First, we show that apparently quite dissimilar classifiers (such as nearest neighbour matching to texton class histograms) can be mapped onto a Random Forest architecture. Second, based on this insight, we show that the performance of such classifiers can be improved by incorporating the spatial context and discriminative learning that arises naturally in the Random Forest framework. Finally, we show that the ability of Random Forests to combine multiple features leads to a further increase in performance when textons, colour, filterbanks, and HOG features are used simultaneously. The benefit of the multi-feature classifier is demonstrated with extensive experimentation on existing labelled image datasets. The method equals or exceeds the state of the art on these datasets.},

abstract = {The objective of developing this software is to achieve auto-segmentation and tissue characterization. Therefore, the present algorithm has been designed and developed for analysis of medical images based on hybridization of syntactic and statistical approaches, using artificial neural network (ANN). This algorithm performs segmentation and classification as is done in human vision system, which recognizes objects; perceives depth; identifies different textures, curved surfaces, or a surface inclination by texture information and brightness. The analysis of medical image is directly based on four steps: 1) image filtering, 2) segmentation, 3) feature extraction, and 4) analysis of extracted features by pattern recognition system or classifier. In this paper, an attempt has been made to present an approach for soft tissue characterization utilizing texture-primitive features with ANN as segmentation and classifier tool. The present approach directly combines second, third, and fourth steps into one algorithm. This is a semisupervised approach in which supervision is involved only at the level of defining texture-primitive cell; afterwards, algorithm itself scans the whole image and performs the segmentation and classification in unsupervised mode. The algorithm was first tested on Markov textures, and the success rate achieved in classification was 100\%; further, the algorithm was able to give results on the test images impregnated with distorted Markov texture cell. In addition to this, the output also indicated the level of distortion in distorted Markov texture cell as compared to standard Markov texture cell. Finally, algorithm was applied to selected medical images for segmentation and classification. Results were in agreement with those with manual segmentation and were clinically correlated.},

@article{Styner2006,
abstract = {Shape analysis has become of increasing interest to the neuroimaging community due to its potential to precisely locate morphological changes between healthy and pathological structures. This manuscript presents a comprehensive set of tools for the computation of 3D structural statistical shape analysis. It has been applied in several studies on brain morphometry, but can potentially be employed in other 3D shape problems. Its main limitations is the necessity of spherical topology.The input of the proposed shape analysis is a set of binary segmentation of a single brain structure, such as the hippocampus or caudate. These segmentations are converted into a corresponding spherical harmonic description (SPHARM), which is then sampled into a triangulated surfaces (SPHARM-PDM). After alignment, differences between groups of surfaces are computed using the Hotelling T(2) two sample metric. Statistical p-values, both raw and corrected for multiple comparisons, result in significance maps. Additional visualization of the group tests are provided via mean difference magnitude and vector maps, as well as maps of the group covariance information.The correction for multiple comparisons is performed via two separate methods that each have a distinct view of the problem. The first one aims to control the family-wise error rate (FWER) or false-positives via the extrema histogram of non-parametric permutations. The second method controls the false discovery rate and results in a less conservative estimate of the false-negatives.},

abstract = {The performance of a supervised k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier and a semisupervised fuzzy c-means (SFCM) clustering segmentation method are evaluated for reproducible measurement of the volumes of normal brain tissues and cerebrospinal fluid. The stability of the two segmentation methods is evaluated for (a) operator selection of training data, (b) reproducibility during repeat imaging sessions to determine any variations in the sensor performance over time, (c) variations in the measured volumes between different subjects, and (d) variability with different imaging parameters. The variations were found to be dependent on the type of measured tissue and the operator performing the segmentations. The variability during repeat imaging sessions for the SFCM method was < 3\%. The absolute volumes of the brain matter and cerebrospinal fluid between subjects varied quite large, ranging from 9\% to 13\%. The intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility for SFCM were < 4\% for the soft tissues and 6\% for cerebrospinal fluid. The corresponding results for the kNN segmentation method were higher compared to the SFCM method.},

abstract = {A new algorithm is presented for the automatic segmentation and classification of brain tissue from 3D MR scans. It uses discriminative Random Decision Forest classification and takes into account partial volume effects. This is combined with correction of intensities for the MR bias field, in conjunction with a learned model of spatial context, to achieve accurate voxel-wise classification. Our quantitative validation, carried out on existing labelled datasets, demonstrates improved results over the state of the art, especially for the cerebro-spinal fluid class which is the most difficult to label accurately.},

It is one of the most important steps for medical diagnosis and quantitative analysis. This paper proposes an automatic segmentation method based on support vector machine (SVM). Feature vectors are generated according to both grayscale value and texture pattern of MR brain images. To speed up, some results are acquired directly from the segmentation model trained in adjacent layers. Further more, morphological image processing is introduced to refine the image contour. The experiment shows that our method can achieve good segmentation results in a fast way. 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {A novel image segmentation approach by exploring one-class support vector machine (SVM) has been developed for the extraction of brain tumor from magnetic resonance (MR) images. Based on one-class SVM, the proposed method has the ability of learning the nonlinear distribution of the image data without prior knowledge, via the automatic procedure of SVM parameters training and an implicit learning kernel. After the learning process, the segmentation task is performed. The proposed technique is applied to 24 clinical MR images of brain tumor for both visual and quantitative evaluations. Experimental results suggest that the proposed query-based approach provides an effective and promising method for brain tumor extraction from MR images with high accuracy},
