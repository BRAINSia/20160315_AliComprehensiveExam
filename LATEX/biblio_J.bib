abstract = {Recent imaging evidence in Alzheimer's disease suggests that neural involvement in early-stage disease is more complex than is encapsulated in the commonly held position of predominant mesial temporal lobe degeneration-there is also early posterior cingulate cortex and diencephalic damage. These findings suggest that early clinical Alzheimer's disease is underpinned by damage to an inter-connected network. If correct, this hypothesis would predict degeneration of the white matter pathways that connect this network. This prediction can be tested in vivo by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Most diffusion tensor imaging studies of white matter in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease have concentrated on fractional anisotropy reductions and increased 'apparent' diffusivity; however, there is a lack of empirical biological evidence to assume that fractional anisotropy changes will necessarily capture the full extent of white matter changes in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, therefore, we undertook a comprehensive investigation of diffusion behaviour in Alzheimer's disease by analysing each of the component eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor in isolation to test the hypothesis that early Alzheimer's disease is associated with degeneration of a specific neural network. Using tract-based spatial statistics, we performed voxel-wise analyses of fractional anisotropy, axial, radial and mean diffusivities in 25 Alzheimer's disease patients compared with 13 elderly controls. We found that increased absolute (axial, radial and mean) diffusivities in Alzheimer's disease were concordant in a distribution consistent with the network hypothesis, highly statistically significant and far more sensitive than fractional anisotropy reductions. The former three measures identified confluent white matter abnormalities in parahippocampal gyrus and posterior cingulum, extending laterally into adjacent temporo-parietal regions as well as splenium and fornix. The caudal occipital lobe, temporal pole, genu and prefrontal white matter were relatively preserved. This distribution is highly consistent with expected predictions of tract degeneration from grey matter lesions identified by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Concordant with results from these other imaging modalities, this pattern predominantly involves degeneration of the tracts connecting the circuit of Papez. These findings also highlight that early neuropathological processes are associated with changes of the diffusion ellipsoid that are predominantly proportional along all semi-principal axes.},

abstract = {A theoretical framework is presented for understanding the effects of noise on estimates of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor at moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios. Image noise produces a random perturbation of the diffusion tensor. Power series solutions to the eigenvalue equation are used to evaluate the effects of the perturbation to second order. It is shown that in anisotropic systems the expectation value of the largest eigenvalue is overestimated and the lowest eigenvalue is underestimated. Hence, diffusion anisotropy is overestimated in general. This result is independent of eigenvalue sorting bias. Furthermore, averaging eigenvalues over a region of interest produces greater bias than averaging tensors prior to diagonalization. Finally, eigenvector noise is shown to depend on the eigenvalue contrast and imposes a theoretical limit on the accuracy of simple fiber tracking schemes. The theoretical results are shown to agree with Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {The organization of the prefrontocaudate connection in the macaque monkey was studied with a polyacrylamide gel of horseradish peroxidase that was injected, after callosotomy, into the head of the caudate nucleus. Tissues were processed for peroxidase activity with tetramethylbenzidine. Retrogradely labeled cells appeared bilaterally in the prefrontal cortex, and ipsilaterally in the premotor area, frontal operculum, insula, and rostral region of the temporal cortex. In the prefrontal cortex, labeled cells were located in cortical layers 2-6. In layer 2, labeled cells were occasionally seen. In layer 3, a considerable number of labeled cells were seen and were mainly distributed in its lower part. They were pyramidal cells. Layer 4 contained a considerable number of labeled cells that were pyramidal or round. Somal sizes of these labeled cells were from 5 to 15 micron, but none of the cells less than 5 micron were labeled. Layer 5 was densely packed with labeled cells, though at a higher density in its upper part (5a). They were pyramidal cells. In layer 6, pyramidal or fusiform cells were labeled at a lower density than in layer 5. The laminar pattern and density of labeled cells were different among various regions of the prefrontal cortex, but, in general, the supragranular labeling tended to frequently occur in the regions containing the numerous labeled cells. There was a topographical relationship between the prefrontal regions containing the majority of labeled cells and the injection sites in the head of the caudate nucleus: the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the medial surface extending downward from the rostral sulcus project ipsilaterally to the medialmost portion of the ventromedial part of the head of the nucleus, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex projects to the ventromedial part of the head of the nucleus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ventral to the principal sulcus projects to the central part of the head of the nucleus. Our findings in the macaque monkey indicate that the corticocaudate connection is similar in laminar organization of efferent neurons to the corticocortical connections.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DT-MRI or DTI) is an emerging imaging modality whose importance has been growing considerably. However, the processing of this type of data (i.e., symmetric positive-definite matrices), called "tensors" here, has proved difficult in recent years. Usual Euclidean operations on matrices suffer from many defects on tensors, which have led to the use of many ad hoc methods. Recently, affine-invariant Riemannian metrics have been proposed as a rigorous and general framework in which these defects are corrected. These metrics have excellent theoretical properties and provide powerful processing tools, but also lead in practice to complex and slow algorithms. To remedy this limitation, a new family of Riemannian metrics called Log-Euclidean is proposed in this article. They also have excellent theoretical properties and yield similar results in practice, but with much simpler and faster computations. This new approach is based on a novel vector space structure for tensors. In this framework, Riemannian computations can be converted into Euclidean ones once tensors have been transformed into their matrix logarithms. Theoretical aspects are presented and the Euclidean, affine-invariant, and Log-Euclidean frameworks are compared experimentally. The comparison is carried out on interpolation and regularization tasks on synthetic and clinical 3D DTI data.},

@article{Ashburner2000,
abstract = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data.},

abstract = {The goal of this research is to promote variational methods for anatomical averaging that operate within the space of the underlying image registration problem. This approach is effective when using the large deformation viscous framework, where linear averaging is not valid, or in the elastic case. The theory behind this novel atlas building algorithm is similar to the traditional pairwise registration problem, but with single image forces replaced by average forces. These group forces drive an average transport ordinary differential equation allowing one to estimate the geodesic that moves an image toward the mean shape configuration. This model gives large deformation atlases that are optimal with respect to the shape manifold as defined by the data and the image registration assumptions. We use the techniques in the large deformation context here, but they also pertain to small deformation atlas construction. Furthermore, a natural, inherently inverse consistent image registration is gained for free, as is a tool for constant arc length geodesic shape interpolation. The geodesic atlas creation algorithm is quantitatively compared to the Euclidean anatomical average to elucidate the need for optimized atlases. The procedures generate improved average representations of highly variable anatomy from distinct populations.},

The algorithm uses the fixed Langrangian reference frame to define the map between coordinate systems, but also generates and stores the inverse map from the Eulerian to the Lagrangian frame. Computing both maps allows facile computation of both Eulerian and Langrangian quantities. We apply this algorithm to estimating a putative evolutionary change of coordinates between a population of chimpanzee and human cortices. Inter-species functional homologues fix the map explicitly, where they are known, while image similarities guide the alignment elsewhere. This map allows detailed study of the volumetric change between chimp and human cortex. Instead of basing the inter-species study on a single species atlas, we diffeomorphically connect the mean shape and intensity templates for each group. The human statistics then map diffeomorphically into the space of the chimpanzee cortex providing a comparison between species. The population statistics show a significant doubling of the relative prefrontal lobe size in humans, as compared to chimpanzees.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

Four dataset-specific strategies are quantitatively contrasted: the "closest to average" individual template, the average shape version of the closest to average template, a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS). The cross-correlation similarity metric drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that, with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy, optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts the study of diseased hippocampi.},

abstract = {Neuropathologic and neuroimaging studies have suggested that frontal lobes are affected in Huntington's disease (HD), and that atrophy in this region may be associated with some of the cognitive impairment and clinical decline observed in patients with HD. We measured gray and white matter volumes within the frontal lobes on MRI for 20 patients with HD (10 mildly affected and 10 moderately affected) and 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects. We also correlated frontal lobe measurements with measures of symptom severity and cognitive function. Patients who were mildly affected had frontal lobe volumes (both gray and white matter) essentially identical to those of control subjects, despite clearly abnormal basal ganglia. Patients who were moderately affected demonstrated significant reductions in total frontal lobe volume (17\%) and frontal white matter volume (28\%). Frontal lobe white matter volume reductions, but not total frontal lobe volume reductions, were disproportionately greater than overall brain volume reductions (17\%). Frontal lobe volume correlated with symptom severity and general cognitive function, but these correlations did not remain significant after taking into account total brain volume. We conclude that cognitive impairment and symptom severity are associated with frontal lobe atrophy, but this association is not specific to the frontal lobes. Frontal lobe atrophy (like total brain atrophy) occurs in later stages of increasing HD symptom severity and this atrophy primarily involves white matter.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted single-shot EPI (sshEPI) is one of the most important tools for the diagnostic assessment of stroke patients, but it suffers from well known artifacts. Therefore, sshEPI was combined with SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) to further increase EPI's potential for stroke imaging. Eight healthy volunteers and a consecutive series of patients (N = 8) with suspected stroke were examined with diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI using different reduction factors (1.0 < or = R < or = 3.0). Additionally, a high-resolution diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI scan was included. All examinations were diagnostic and of better quality than conventional sshEPI. No ghostings or aliasing artifacts were discernible, and EPI-related image distortions were markedly diminished. Chemical shift artifacts and eddy current-induced image warping were still present, although to a markedly smaller extent. Measured direction-dependent diffusion-coefficients and isotropic diffusion values were comparable to previous findings but showed less fluctuation. We have demonstrated the technical feasibility and clinical applicability of diffusion-weighted SENSE-sshEPI in patients with subacute stroke. Because of the faster k-space traversal, this novel technique is able to reduce typical EPI artifacts and increase spatial resolution while simultaneously remaining insensitive to bulk motion.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new NMR imaging modality--MR diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.},

These include Diffusion Imaging (DI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), isotropically weighted imaging, and q-space imaging. Just as DI provides useful information about molecular displacements in one dimension with which to characterize diffusion in isotropic tissues, DTI provides information about molecular displacements in three dimensions needed to characterize diffusion is anisotropic tissues. DTI also furnishes scalar parameters that behave like quantitative histological or physiological 'stains' for different features of diffusion. These include Trace(D), which is related to the mean diffusivity, and a family of parameters derived from the diffusion tensor, D, which characterize different features of anisotropic diffusion. Simple thought experiments and geometrical constructs, such as the diffusion ellipsoid, can be used to understand water diffusion in isotropic and anisotropic media, and the NMR experiments used to characterize it.},

abstract = {Quantitative-diffusion-tensor MRI consists of deriving and displaying parameters that resemble histological or physiological stains, i.e., that characterize intrinsic features of tissue microstructure and microdynamics. Specifically, these parameters are objective, and insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here, these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from the effective diffusion tensor, D, which is estimated in each voxel. First, D is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts, [D] I and D - [D] I, respectively (where [D] = Trace(D)/3 is the mean diffusivity, and I is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor (dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion tensor images (in which D is estimated in each voxel from a series of 2D-FT spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain. Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and disease.},

This approach was validated using synthesized, noisy DT-MRI data. Corpus callosum and pyramidal tract trajectories were constructed and found to be consistent with known anatomy. The method's reliability, however, degrades where the distribution of fiber tract directions is nonuniform. Moreover, background noise in diffusion-weighted MRIs can cause a computed trajectory to hop from tract to tract. Still, this method can provide quantitative information with which to visualize and study connectivity and continuity of neural pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems in vivo, and holds promise for elucidating architectural features in other fibrous tissues and ordered media.},

abstract = {The subject of this study is the controversial choice of directions in diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI); specifically, the numerical algebra related to this choice. In DT-MRI, apparent diffusivities are sampled in six or more directions and a least-squares equation is solved to reconstruct the diffusion tensor. Numerical characteristics of the system are considered, in particular the condition number and normal matrix, and are shown to be dependent on the relative orientation of the tensor with respect to the laboratory frame. As a consequence, noise propagation can be anisotropic. However, the class of icosahedral direction schemes is an exception, and icosahedral directions have the same condition number and normal matrix for direction encoding as the ideal scheme with an infinite number of directions. This normal matrix and its condition number are rotationally invariant. Numerical simulations show that for icosahedral schemes with 30 directions the standard deviation of the fractional anisotropy is both low and nearly independent of fiber orientation. The recommended choice of directions for a DT-MRI experiment is therefore the icosahedral set of directions with the highest number of directions achievable in the available time.},

@article{Beal2013,
abstract = {It is well documented that neuroanatomical differences exist between adults who stutter and their fluently speaking peers. Specifically, adults who stutter have been found to have more grey matter volume (GMV) in speech relevant regions including inferior frontal gyrus, insula and superior temporal gyrus (Beal et al., 2007; Song et al., 2007). Despite stuttering having its onset in childhood only one study has investigated the neuroanatomical differences between children who do and do not stutter. Chang et al. (2008) reported children who stutter had less GMV in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri and middle temporal gyrus relative to fluently speaking children. Thus it appears that children who stutter present with unique neuroanatomical abnormalities as compared to those of adults who stutter. In order to better understand the neuroanatomical correlates of stuttering earlier in its development, near the time of onset, we used voxel-based morphometry to examine volumetric differences between 11 children who stutter and 11 fluent children. Children who stutter had less GMV in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri and left putamen but more GMV in right Rolandic operculum and superior temporal gyrus relative to fluent children. Children who stutter also had less white matter volume bilaterally in the forceps minor of the corpus callosum. We discuss our findings of widespread anatomic abnormalities throughout the cortical network for speech motor control within the context of the speech motor skill limitations identified in people who stutter (Namasivayam and van Lieshout, 2008; Smits-Bandstra et al., 2006).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare white matter (WM) integrity in children with MS and healthy children using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and correlate DTI findings with disease activity, lesion burden, and cognitive processing speed.

METHODS: Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were measured in four corpus callosum (CC), eight hemispheric regions, and the normal-appearing thalamus of 33 children and adolescents with MS and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Images were acquired on a GE LX 1.5T scanner. DTI parameters used were 25 directions, b = 1000 s/mm(2), and 5mm slice thickness. MS patients had T2 lesion volumes and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were measured; all participants underwent two speeded cognitive tasks (Visual Matching and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)).

RESULTS: MS participants displayed lower FA values in the genu (p<0.005), splenium (p<0.001) and in NAWM of bilateral parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes (p<0.001) versus controls. FA and MD in the thalamus did not differ between groups. Higher lesion volumes correlated with reduced FA in CC and hemispheric NAWM. DTI metrics did not correlate with EDSS. FA values in CC regions correlated with Visual Matching (p<0.001) and SDMT (p<0.005) in MS participants only.

INTERPRETATION: DTI analyses indicate widespread NAWM disruption in children with MS-with the degree of abnormality correlating with impaired cognitive processing speed. These findings support an early onset tissue pathology in MS and illustrate its functional consequence.},

To investigate WM degeneration we used Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics to compare Fractional Anisotropy, Mean Diffusivity (MD), parallel diffusivity and perpendicular diffusivity ($\lambda$⊥) in WM throughout the whole brain in 17 clinically diagnosed HD patients and 16 matched controls. Significant WM diffusivity abnormalities were identified primarily in the corpus callosum (CC) and external/extreme capsules in HD patients compared to controls. Significant correlations were observed between motor symptoms and MD in the CC body, and between global cognitive impairment and $\lambda$⊥ in the CC genu. Probabilistic tractography from these regions revealed degeneration of functionally relevant interhemispheric WM tracts. Our findings suggest that WM degeneration within interhemispheric pathways plays an important role in the deterioration of cognitive and motor function in HD patients, and that improved understanding of WM pathology early in the disease is required.},

abstract = {The striatum, the primary site of degeneration in Huntington's disease (HD), connects to the cerebral cortex via topographically organized circuits subserving unique motor, associative and limbic functions. Currently, it is not known whether all cortico-striatal circuits are equally affected in HD. We aimed to study the selective vulnerability of individual cortico-striatal circuits within the striatum in HD, and hypothesized that motor cortico-striatal pathways would be most affected, consistent with HD being a primarily motor disorder. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography was used to identify connections between the striatum and seven major cortical regions in 12 HD patients and 14 matched controls. The striatum of both groups was parcellated into subregions based on connectivity with the cerebral cortex. Volumetric and DTI microstructural measures of Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and Mean Diffusivity (MD) were obtained within each subregion and compared statistically between groups. Tractography demonstrated the topographic organization of cortical connections in the striatum of both controls and HD patients. In HD patients, the greatest difference from controls in volume, FA and MD was observed in M1 and S1 subregions of the caudate and putamen. Motor symptoms correlated with volume and MD in sensorimotor striatal subregions, suggesting that sensorimotor striatal degeneration is closely related to motor dysfunction. DTI tractography provides a novel approach to sensitively examine circuit-specific abnormalities in HD and has identified that the motor cortico-striatal circuit is selectively vulnerable in HD.},

abstract = {A disturbance in the frontal-striatal-thalamic circuitry has been proposed for schizophrenia, but this concept has been based primarily on indirect evidence from psychopharmacology and analogies with animal research. Diffusion tensor imaging, a new MRI technique that permits direct assessment of the large axon masses stretching from the prefrontal cortex to the striatum, was used to study white matter axon bundles. Diffusion tensor images, high-resolution structural MRI and positron emission tomography scans with 18-fluorodexoyglucose were obtained on five patients with schizophrenia and six age- and sex-matched normal controls. Significantly lower diffusion anisotropy in the white matter of the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenic patients than in normal controls was observed in statistical probability maps. Co-registered PET scans revealed significantly lower correlation coefficients between metabolic rates in the prefrontal cortex and striatum in patients than in controls. These twin findings provide convergent evidence for diminished fronto-striatal connectivity in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Previous research suggests that, in reaction time (RT) measures of episodic memory retrieval, the unique effects of adult age are relatively small compared to the effects aging shares with more elementary abilities such as perceptual speed. Little is known, however, regarding the mechanisms of perceptual speed. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to test the hypothesis that white matter integrity, as indexed by fractional anisotropy (FA), serves as one mechanism of perceptual slowing in episodic memory retrieval. Results indicated that declines in FA in the pericallosal frontal region and in the genu of the corpus callosum, but not in other regions, mediated the relationship between perceptual speed and episodic retrieval RT. This relation held, though to a different degree, for both hits and correct rejections. These findings suggest that white matter integrity in prefrontal regions is one mechanism underlying the relation between individual differences in perceptual speed and episodic retrieval.},

abstract = {We collected MRI diffusion tensor imaging data from 80 younger (20–32 years) and 63 older (60–71 years) healthy adults. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis revealed that white matter integrity, as indicated by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), was disrupted in numerous structures in older compared to younger adults. These regions displayed five distinct region-specific patterns of age-related differences in other diffusivity properties: (1) increases in both radial and mean diffusivity; (2) increases in radial diffusivity; (3) no differences in parameters other than FA; (4) a decrease in axial and an increase in radial diffusivity; and (5) a decrease in axial and mean diffusivity. These patterns suggest different biological underpinnings of age-related decline in FA, such as demyelination, Wallerian degeneration, gliosis, and severe fiber loss, and may represent stages in a cascade of age-related degeneration in white matter microstructure. This first simultaneous description of age-related differences in FA, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity requires histological and functional validation as well as analyses of intermediate age groups and longitudinal samples.},

abstract = {Lateralization of language to the left hemisphere is considered a key aspect of human brain organization. We used diffusion tensor MRI to perform in vivo virtual dissection of language pathways to assess the relationship between brain asymmetry and cognitive performance in the normal population. Our findings suggest interhemispheric differences in direct connections between Broca's and Wernicke's territories, with extreme leftward lateralization in more than half of the subjects and bilateral symmetrical distribution in only 17.5\% of the subjects. Importantly, individuals with more symmetric patterns of connections are better overall at remembering words using semantic association. Moreover, preliminary analysis suggests females are more likely to have a symmetrical pattern of connections. These findings suggest that the degree of lateralization of perisylvian pathways is heterogeneous in the normal population and, paradoxically, bilateral representation, not extreme lateralization, might ultimately be advantageous for specific cognitive functions.},

Introduced by luminaries of 19th Century neurology and resurrected by the charismatic work of Norman Geschwind, the disconnection theme has triggered spectacular advances of modern understanding of language and aphasia. But the disconnection paradigm had alternate fortunes, ranging from irrational exuberance to benign neglect, and its followers have not always shared the same view on its functional consequences and anatomical correlates. Our goal in this paper is, first, to survey the 19th Century roots of the connectionist approach to aphasia and, second, to describe emerging imaging technologies based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that promise to consolidate and expand the disconnection approach to language and its disorders.},

In this paper, the effects of DWI artifacts on estimated tensor values, such as trace and fractional anisotropy, are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations. A novel approach for robust diffusion tensor estimation, called RESTORE (for robust estimation of tensors by outlier rejection), is proposed. This method uses iteratively reweighted least-squares regression to identify potential outliers and subsequently exclude them. Results from both simulated and clinical diffusion data sets indicate that the RESTORE method improves tensor estimation compared to the commonly used linear and nonlinear least-squares tensor fitting methods and a recently proposed method based on the Geman-McClure M-estimator. The RESTORE method could potentially remove the need for cardiac gating in DWI acquisitions and should be applicable to other MR imaging techniques that use univariate or multivariate regression to fit MRI data to a model.},

abstract = {Fiber tracking, based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), is the only approach available to non-invasively study the three-dimensional structure of white matter tracts. Two major obstacles to this technique are partial volume artifacts and tracking errors caused by image noise. In this paper, a novel fiber tracking algorithm called Guided Tensor Restore Anatomical Connectivity Tractography (GTRACT) is presented. This algorithm utilizes a multi-pass approach to fiber tracking. In the first pass, a 3D graph search algorithm is utilized. The second pass incorporates anatomical connectivity information generated in the first pass to guide the tracking in this stage. This approach improves the ability to reconstruct complex fiber paths as well as the tracking accuracy. Validation and reliability studies using this algorithm were performed on both synthetic phantom data and clinical human brain data. A method is also proposed for the evaluating reliability of fiber tract generation based both on the position of the fiber tracts, as well the anisotropy values along the path. The results demonstrate that the GTRACT algorithm is less sensitive to image noise and more capable of handling areas of complex fiber crossing, compared to conventional streamline methods.},

abstract = {Functional imaging with positron emission tomography and functional MRI has revolutionized studies of the human brain. Understanding the organization of brain systems, especially those used for cognition, remains limited, however, because no methods currently exist for noninvasive tracking of neuronal connections between functional regions [Crick, F. \& Jones, E. (1993) Nature (London) 361, 109-110]. Detailed connectivities have been studied in animals through invasive tracer techniques, but these invasive studies cannot be done in humans, and animal results cannot always be extrapolated to human systems. We have developed noninvasive neuronal fiber tracking for use in living humans, utilizing the unique ability of MRI to characterize water diffusion. We reconstructed fiber trajectories throughout the brain by tracking the direction of fastest diffusion (the fiber direction) from a grid of seed points, and then selected tracks that join anatomically or functionally (functional MRI) defined regions. We demonstrate diffusion tracking of fiber bundles in a variety of white matter classes with examples in the corpus callosum, geniculo-calcarine, and subcortical association pathways. Tracks covered long distances, navigated through divergences and tight curves, and manifested topological separations in the geniculo-calcarine tract consistent with tracer studies in animals and retinotopy studies in humans. Additionally, previously undescribed topologies were revealed in the other pathways. This approach enhances the power of modern imaging by enabling study of fiber connections among anatomically and functionally defined brain regions in individual human subjects.},

abstract = {The statistical reliability of diffusion property measurements was evaluated in ten healthy subjects using deterministic fiber tracking to localize tracts affected in motor neuron disease: corticospinal tract (CST), uncinate fasciculus (UNC), and the corpus callosum in its entirety (CC), and its genu (GE), motor (CCM), and splenium (SP) fibers separately. Measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda(1)), transverse diffusivity (lambda( perpendicular)), and volume of voxels containing fibers (VV) were obtained within each tract. To assess intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, two raters carried out fiber tracking five times on each scan. Scan-rescan and longitudinal reliability were assessed in a subset of four subjects who had six scans, with two sets of three scans separated by 1 year. The statistical reliability of repeated measurements was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficients of variation (CV). Spatial agreement of tract shape was assessed using the kappa (kappa) statistic. Results: Repeated same-scan fiber tracking evaluations showed good geometric alignment (intra-rater kappa >0.90, inter-rater kappa >0.76) and reliable diffusion property measurements (intra-rater ICC >0.92, inter-rater ICC >0.77). FA, MD, and lambda( perpendicular) were highly reliable with repeated scans on different days, up to a year apart (ICC >0.8). VV also exhibited good reliability, but with higher CVs. We were unable to demonstrate reproducibility of lambda(1). Longitudinal reliability after one year was improved by averaging measurements from multiple scans at each time point. Fiber tracking provides a reliable tool for the longitudinal evaluation of white matter diffusion properties.},

abstract = {Regression analysis is a powerful tool for the study of changes in a dependent variable as a function of an in- dependent regressor variable, and in particular it is ap- plicable to the study of anatomical growth and shape change. When the underlying process can be modeled by parameters in a Euclidean space, classical regression tech- niques [13, 34] are applicable and have been studied ex- tensively. However, recent work suggests that attempts to describe anatomical shapes using flat Euclidean spaces un- dermines our ability to represent natural biological vari- ability [9, 11]. In this paper we develop a method for regression analy- sis of general, manifold-valued data. Specifically, we extend Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression by recasting the regres- sion problem in terms of Fr´ echet expectation. Although this method is quite general, our driving problem is the study anatomical shape change as a function of age from random design image data. We demonstrate our method by analyzing shape change in the brain from a random design dataset of MR images of 89 healthy adults ranging in age from 22 to 79 years. To study the small scale changes in anatomy, we use the infinite dimensional manifold of diffeomorphic transforma- tions, with an associated metric. We regress a representa- tive anatomical shape, as a function of age, from this popu- lation.},

abstract = {Neuropathological studies in Huntington disease (HD) have demonstrated neuronal loss in the striatum, as well as in other brain regions including the cortex. With diffusion tensor MRI we evaluated the hypothesis that the clinical dysfunction in HD is related to regionally specific lesions of circuit-specific cortico-basal ganglia networks rather than to the striatum only. We included 27 HD and 24 controls from the TRACK-HD Paris cohort. The following assessments were used: self-paced tapping tasks, trail B making test (TMT), University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT), and apathy scores from the problem behaviors assessment. Group comparisons of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity and correlations were performed using voxel-based analysis. In the cortex, HD patients showed significant correlations between: (i) self paced tapping and mean diffusivity in the parietal lobe at 1.8 Hz and prefrontal areas at 3 Hz, (ii) UPSIT and mean diffusivity in the parietal, and median temporal lobes, the cingulum and the insula, and fractional anisotropy in the insula and the external capsule, (iii) TMT B and mean diffusivity in the white matter of the superior frontal, orbital, temporal, superior parietal and post central areas, and (iv) apathy and fractional anisotropy in the white matter of the rectus gyrus. In the basal ganglia, we found correlations between the self paced tapping, UPSIT, TMT tests, and mean diffusivity in the anterior part of the putamen and the caudate nucleus. In conclusion, disruption of motor, associative and limbic cortico-striatal circuits differentially contribute to the clinical signs of the disease.

@article{DiPaola2010,
abstract = {The corpus callosum (CC), which connects the two cerebral hemispheres, is the largest white matter fiber bundle in the human brain. This structure presents a peculiar myelination pattern: it has small diameter fibers, located in the genu, which myelinate much later in normal development, and large diameter fibers of the splenium, which myelinate early in development. Although the pathology of AD mainly involves the cerebral gray matter structure, there is evidence that white matter may also be involved. To illustrate callosal white matter changes in AD pathology, in this review we summarize in vivo imaging studies in humans, focusing on region of interest, voxel-based morphometry, diffusion-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging techniques. Our aims were to identify where in the CC, when in the different stages of AD, and how callosal changes can be detected with different MRI techniques. Results showed that changes in the anterior (genu and anterior body) as well as in the posterior (isthmus and splenum) portions of the CC might already be present in the early stages of AD. These findings support the hypothesis that two mechanisms, Wallerian degeneration and myelin breakdown, might be responsible for the region-specific changes detected in AD patients. Wallerian degeneration affects the posterior CC subregion, which receives axons directly from those brain areas (temporo-parietal lobe regions) primarily affected by the AD pathology. Instead, the myelin breakdown process affects the later-myelinating CC subregion and explains the earlier involvement of the genu in CC atrophy.},

abstract = {Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that abnormalities in Huntington's disease (HD) extend to white matter (WM) tracts in early HD and even in presymptomatic stages. Thus, changes of the corpus callosum (CC) may reflect various aspects of HD pathogenesis. We recruited 17 HD patients, 17 pre-HD subjects, and 34 healthy age-matched controls. Three-dimensional anatomical MRI and diffusion tensor images of the brain were acquired on a 3T scanner. Combining region-of-interest analyses, voxel-based morphometry, and tract-based spatial statistics, we investigated callosal thickness, WM density, fractional anisotropy, and radial and axial diffusivities. Compared with controls, pre-HD subjects showed reductions of the isthmus, likely due to myelin damage. Compared with pre-HD subjects, HD patients showed reductions of isthmus and body, with axonal damage confined to the body. Compared with controls, HD patients had significantly decreased callosal measures in extended regions across almost the entire CC. At this disease stage, both myelin and axonal damage are detectable. Supplementary multiple regression analyses revealed that WM reduction density in the isthmus as well as Disease Burden scores allowed to predict the "HD development" index. While callosal changes seem to proceed in a posterior-to-anterior direction as the diseases progresses, this observation requires validation in future longitudinal investigations.},

@article{Doricchi2008,
abstract = {Seminal case reports collected during the middle part of the XX century, designated the parietal lobe as the principal area of damage in patients suffering from contralesional spatial neglect (Brain WC. Visual disorientation with special reference to lesions of the right cerebral hemisphere. Brain 1941;64:224-72; Paterson A, Zangwill O. Disorders of visual space perception associated with lesions of the right cerebral hemisphere. Brain 1944;67:331-58; McFie J, Piercy MF, Zangwill O. Visual spatial agnosia associated with lesions of the right hemisphere. Brain 1950;73:167-90). Based on this evidence, textbooks of neurology have traditionally referred to neglect as a "parietal sign". This view found complete accomplishment in the 1986 group study by Vallar and Perani, who confirmed that the inferior parietal lobe was the area most frequently involved in neglect patients with lesions confined to the cerebral cortex and lesions involving subcortical gray matter nuclei. In the same study, it was found that lesions limited to subcortical white matter were rarely associated with neglect. Here, we reconsider recent accumulating evidence, gathered from investigations in animals and human patients, supporting the partially different view that damage involvement of long-range white matter bundles connecting the parietal to the frontal lobe, importantly influence the occurrence and severity of spatial neglect. These findings do not dispute the role of the parietal and frontal cortex in spatial attention and space-related behaviour, but call for a reappraisal of the respective roles of disruption of white matter connections and damage of gray matter cortical modules in the pathophysiology of neglect. Disentangling the connectional and modular anatomical correlates of neglect may be crucial to better understand the pathophysiology of this syndrome, to explain the manifold clinical dissociations often encountered in clinical practice and to increase the impact of behavioural and pharmacological interventions. In this review, we focus on the role of within-hemisphere white-matter disconnection. The role of interhemispheric disconnection, perhaps the oldest connectionist theory of neglect (Geschwind N. Disconnexion syndromes in animals and man - part II. Brain 1965;88:585-644), was extensively treated elsewhere (Bartolomeo P, Thiebaut de Schotten M, Doricchi F. Left unilateral neglect as a disconnection syndrome, Cerebral Cortex 2007;45:3127-48). We first summarise the structure of long-range white matter connections within the cerebral hemispheres and sketch a brief historical review of the original findings suggesting the role of intrahemispheric disconnection to neglect. We then revisit some of the current functional interpretation of the neglect syndrome in the light of disconnectionist approach and review evidences favouring or disfavouring a purely disconnectionist interpretation of the syndrome. Finally, we address the issue of diagnostic criteria to be used in future anatomo-clinical studies aiming at investigating the role of white matter and gray matter dysfunctions in spatial neglect.},

@article{Dubois2008,
abstract = {The development of cognitive functions during childhood relies on several neuroanatomical maturation processes. Among these processes is myelination of the white matter pathways, which speeds up electrical conduction. Quantitative indices of such structural processes can be obtained in vivo with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), but their physiological significance remains uncertain. Here, we investigated the microstructural correlates of early functional development by combining DTI and visual event-related potentials (VEPs) in 15 one- to 4-month-old healthy infants. Interindividual variations of the apparent conduction speed, computed from the latency of the first positive VEP wave (P1), were significantly correlated with the infants' age and DTI indices measured in the optic radiations. This demonstrates that fractional anisotropy and transverse diffusivity are structural markers of functionally efficient myelination. Moreover, these indices computed along the optic radiations showed an early wave of maturation in the anterior region, with the posterior region catching up later in development, which suggests two asynchronous fronts of myelination in both the geniculocortical and corticogeniculate fibers. Thus, in addition to microstructural information, DTI provides noninvasive exquisite information on the functional development of the brain in human infants.},

@article{Duering2011,
abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease is the most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment. It typically manifests with lacunar infarcts and ischaemic white matter lesions. However, little is known about how these lesions relate to the cognitive symptoms. Previous studies have found a poor correlation between the burden of ischaemic lesions and cognitive symptoms, thus leaving much of the variance in cognitive performance unexplained. The objective of the current study was to investigate the relationship between the location of subcortical ischaemic lesions and cognitive symptoms in small vessel disease. We applied a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach to data from 215 patients with CADASIL, a genetically defined small vessel disease with mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. All patients were examined by magnetic resonance imaging and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. Lacunar lesions and white matter lesions were segmented on three-dimensional T(1) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, respectively. One hundred and forty-five subjects had a total of 854 lacunar lesions (range 1-13 per individual). The normalized volume of white matter hyperintensities ranged from 0.0425\% to 21.5\% of the intracranial cavity. Significant clusters for cognitive performance were detected for both lacunar lesions and white matter hyperintensities. The most prominent results were obtained on a compound score for processing speed, the predominantly affected cognitive domain in this group of patients. Strategic locations included the anterior parts of the thalamus, the genu and anterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior corona radiata and the genu of the corpus callosum. By combining the lesion-symptom mapping data with information from a probabilistic white matter atlas we found that the majority of the processing speed clusters projected on the anterior thalamic radiation and the forceps minor. In multivariate models that included demographic parameters, brain atrophy and the volume of ischaemic lesions, regional volumes of lacunar lesions and white matter hyperintensities in the anterior thalamic radiation predicted performance in processing speed tasks, whereas there was no independent contribution of the global volume of ischaemic lesions. These observations emphasize the importance of lesion location for both lacunar and ischaemic white matter lesions. Our findings further highlight the anterior thalamic radiation as a major anatomical structure impacting on processing speed. Together these findings provide strong support for a central role of frontal-subcortical circuits in cerebral small vessel disease and vascular cognitive impairment.},

@article{Dumas2012,
abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the function-structure relationship of white matter within different stages of Huntington's disease (HD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Experimental design: From the TRACK-HD study, an early stage HD group and a premanifest gene carrier group (PMGC) were age-matched to two healthy control groups; all underwent 3-T MRI scanning of the brain. Region of interest (ROI) segmentation of the corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and sensorimotor cortex was applied, and the apparent fiber pathways of these regions were analyzed. Functional measures of motor, oculomotor, cognition, and behavior were correlated to DTI measures. Principle observations: In PMGC versus controls, higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was seen in white matter pathways of the sensorimotor cortex (P < 0.01) and in the ROI of corpus callosum (P < 0.017). In early HD, fiber tract analysis showed higher ADC in pathways of the corpus callosum, thalamus, sensorimotor, and prefrontal region (P < 0.01). ROI analysis showed higher diffusivity in the corpus callosum and caudate nucleus (P < 0.017). Motor, oculomotor, cognition, and probability of onset within 2 and 5 years, correlated well with ADC measures of the corpus callosum (P < 0.01 - P < 0.005), sensorimotor (P < 0.01 - P < 0.005), and prefrontal region (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Disturbances in the white matter connections of the sensorimotor cortex can be demonstrated not only in manifest HD but also in premanifest gene carriers. Connectivity measures are well related to clinical functioning. DTI measures can be regarded as a potential biomarker for HD, due to their ability to objectify changes in brain structures and their role within brain networks.

@article{Ennis2006,
abstract = {This paper outlines the mathematical development and application of two analytically orthogonal tensor invariants sets. Diffusion tensors can be mathematically decomposed into shape and orientation information, determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively. The developments herein orthogonally decompose the tensor shape using a set of three orthogonal invariants that characterize the magnitude of isotropy, the magnitude of anisotropy, and the mode of anisotropy. The mode of anisotropy is useful for resolving whether a region of anisotropy is linear anisotropic, orthotropic, or planar anisotropic. Both tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are members of an orthogonal invariant set, but they do not belong to the same set. It is proven that tensor trace and fractional anisotropy are not mutually orthogonal measures of the diffusive process. The results are applied to the analysis and visualization of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images of the brain in a healthy volunteer. The theoretical developments provide a method for generating scalar maps of the diffusion tensor data, including novel fractional anisotropy maps that are color encoded for the mode of anisotropy and directionally encoded colormaps of only linearly anisotropic structures, rather than of high fractional anisotropy structures.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging and studies of brain-damaged patients made it possible to delineate the main components of the cerebral system for word reading. However, the anatomical connections subtending the flow of information within this network are still poorly defined. Here we study the connectivity of the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), a pivotal component of the reading network achieving the invariant identification of letter strings, and reproducibly located in the left lateral occipitotemporal sulcus. Diffusion images and functional imaging data were gathered in a patient who developed pure alexia following a small surgical lesion in the vicinity of his VWFA. We had a unique opportunity to compare images obtained before, early after, and late after surgery. Analysis of diffusion images with white matter tractography and voxel-based morphometry showed that the VWFA was mainly linked to the occipital cortex through the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), and to perisylvian language areas (supramarginal gyrus) through the arcuate fasciculus. After surgery, we observed the progressive and selective degeneration of the ILF, while the VWFA was anatomically intact. This allowed us to establish the critical causal role of this fiber tract in normal reading, and to show that its disruption is one pathophysiological mechanism of pure alexia, thus clarifying a long-standing debate on the role of disconnection in neurocognitive disorders.},

abstract = {The aim of our study was to quantify the structural integrity of the long association fibre tracts in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to correlate the findings with the cognitive performance of the patients. We conducted region-of-interest-based analyses of color-coded diffusion-tensor imaging in 12 patients with early AD (age 69.8+/-8.0 years; MMSE 25.3+/-1.8) and 16 age- and education-matched healthy controls. Early AD patients showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cingulate bundles and the inferior fronto-occipital fascicles bilaterally, whereas FA values of the superior longitudinal fascicles (second division) did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Neuropsychological performance of patients in the verbal episodic memory test domain correlated significantly with disturbances of left cingulate fibre tract integrity. Reduced left cingulate bundle integrity was most strongly correlated with impaired performance in a verbal recognition task (Spearman's rho=0.81, P=0.001). Moreover, Boston naming test performance also correlated with the left cingulate bundle integrity (Spearman's rho=0.71, P=0.009). These findings suggest substantial disturbances of the structural connectivity within long association fibre tracts, especially the cingulate bundles and the inferior fronto-occipital fascicles, in early AD and highlight the important role of the cingulate bundles in verbal recognition.},

abstract = {Accurate and automated methods for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex could provide powerful tools for diagnosing and studying a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test-retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.},

The classification technique employs a registration procedure that is robust to anatomical variability, including the ventricular enlargement typically associated with neurological diseases and aging.

abstract = {There is still limited knowledge about the relationship between different structural brain parameters, despite huge progress in analysis of neuroimaging data. The aim of the present study was to test the relationship between fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and regional white matter (WM) volume. As WM volume has been shown to develop until middle age, the focus was on changes in WM properties in the age range of 40 to 60 years. 100 participants were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each hemisphere was parcellated into 35 WM regions, and volume, FA, axial, and radial diffusion in each region were calculated. The relationships between age and the regional measures of FA and WM volume were tested, and then FA and WM volume were correlated, corrected for intracranial volume, age, and sex. WM volume was weakly related to age, while FA correlated negatively with age in 26 of 70 regions, caused by a mix of reduced axial and increased radial diffusion with age. 23 relationships between FA and WM volume were found, with seven being positive and sixteen negative. The positive correlations were mainly caused by increased radial diffusion. It is concluded that FA is more sensitive than volume to changes in WM integrity during middle age, and that FA-age correlations probably are related to reduced amount of myelin with increasing age. Further, FA and WM volume are moderately to weakly related and to a large extent sensitive to different characteristics of WM integrity.},

@article{Fox2008,
abstract = {Face perception is a function with significant complexity, reflected in cognitive models that propose a hierarchy of parallel and serial processing stages. Current neuroimaging data also show that face perception involves a core processing network of cortical modules, which are likely specialized for different functions involved in face processing. The core face processing network is further linked to an extended face processing network which is not solely involved in the perception of faces, but rather contains modules mediating the processing of semantic, biographic and emotional information about people. The segregation of these processes within discrete anatomic regions creates the potential for disconnection between regions to generate neuropsychological deficits involving faces. In this review we consider the types of disconnection possible both within the core face processing system and between the core and extended systems, the pattern of deficits that would be considered as evidence of such disconnections, the potential anatomy of lesions that would create them, and whether any cases exist that meet these criteria.},

abstract = {There is inevitable physical, cognitive and behavioural decline in Hun- tington’s disease (HD), a dominantly inherited progressive neurological disorder. The hallmark of the disease is chorea, an involuntary brief move- ment that tends to flow between body regions.HDis diagnosed clinically with genetic confirmation. Predictive testing is available; however, it should be undertaken with caution in patients at risk for the disease but without clinical disease expression. Ongoing observational trials have identified not only early subtle motor signs, but also striatal volume, verbal memory and olfaction as possible early manifestations of clinical disease. Multiple areas of the brain degenerate, with dopamine, glutamate and GABA being the pre-dominant neurotransmitters affected in HD. Although many pharmaco- therapies have been evaluated targeting these neurotransmitters, few well conducted trials for symptomatic or neuroprotective interventions have yielded positive results. Tetrabenazine is one of the better studied and more effective agents for reducing chorea, although with a risk of potentially ser- ious adverse effects. Newer antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine and aripiprazolemayhave adequate efficacy with a more favourable adverse-effect profile than older antipsychotics for treating chorea and psychosis. In this review, the pathogenesis, epidemiology and diagnosis ofHDare discussed as background for understanding potential pharmacological treatment options. Potential strategies to delay the progression of HD that have been studied and are planned for the future are summarized. Although there is no current method to change the course of this devastating disease, education and symptomatic therapies are effective tools available to clinicians and the families affected by HD.},

@article{Friston1996,
abstract = {This paper is about detecting activations in statistical parametric maps and considers the relative sensitivity of a nested hierarchy of tests that we have framed in terms of the level of inference (voxel level, cluster level, and set level). These tests are based on the probability of obtaining c, or more, clusters with k, or more, voxels, above a threshold u. This probability has a reasonably simple form and is derived using distributional approximations from the theory of Gaussian fields. The most important contribution of this work is the notion of set-level inference. Set-level inference refers to the statistical inference that the number of clusters comprising an observed activation profile is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. This inference pertains to the set of activations reaching criteria and represents a new way of assigning P values to distributed effects. Cluster-level inferences are a special case of set-level inferences, which obtain when the number of clusters c = 1. Similarly voxel-level inferences are special cases of cluster-level inferences that result when the cluster can be very small (i.e., k = 0). Using a theoretical power analysis of distributed activations, we observed that set-level inferences are generally more powerful than cluster-level inferences and that cluster-level inferences are generally more powerful than voxel-level inferences. The price paid for this increased sensitivity is reduced localizing power: Voxel-level tests permit individual voxels to be identified as significant, whereas cluster-and set-level inferences only allow clusters or sets of clusters to be so identified. For all levels of inference the spatial size of the underlying signal f (relative to resolution) determines the most powerful thresholds to adopt. For set-level inferences if f is large (e.g., fMRI) then the optimum extent threshold should be greater than the expected number of voxels for each cluster. If f is small (e.g., PET) the extent threshold should be small. We envisage that set-level inferences will find a role in making statistical inferences about distributed activations, particularly in fMRI.},

With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates, but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni) tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected. We demonstrate this approach using both simulations and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two simple experiments.},

This paper presents a method for statistical comparison of fiber bundle diffusion properties between populations of diffusion tensor images. Unbiased diffeomorphic atlas building is used to compute a normalized coordinate system for populations of diffusion images. The diffeomorphic transformations between each subject and the atlas provide spatial normalization for the comparison of tract statistics. Diffusion properties, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and tensor norm, along fiber tracts are modeled as multivariate functions of arc length. Hypothesis testing is performed non-parametrically using permutation testing based on the Hotelling T(2) statistic. The linear discriminant embedded in the T(2) metric provides an intuitive, localized interpretation of detected differences. The proposed methodology was tested on two clinical studies of neurodevelopment. In a study of 1 and 2 year old subjects, a significant increase in FA and a correlated decrease in Frobenius norm was found in several tracts. Significant differences in neonates were found in the splenium tract between controls and subjects with isolated mild ventriculomegaly (MVM) demonstrating the potential of this method for clinical studies.},

We also performed an interrater reliability study of the motor assessment. We found there was a high degree of internal consistency within each of the domains of the UHDRS and that there were significant intercorrelations between the domains of the UHDRS, with the exception of the total behavioral score. There was an excellent degree of interrater reliability for the motor scores. Our limited longitudinal database indicates that the UHDRS may be useful for tracking changes in the clinical features of HD over time. The UHDRS assesses relevant clinical features of HD and appears to be appropriate for repeated administration during clinical studies.},

abstract = {The present study analyzes the relationship between cortical and subcortical brain volumes in patients with Huntington's disease. The brains of seven patients with a clinical diagnosis and positive family history of Huntington's disease and 12 controls were collected at autopsy with consent from relatives. Detailed clinical assessments were available for all study subjects with genotype confirmation for patients with Huntington's disease. Volume analysis of the brain on serial 3-mm coronal slices was performed as previously described. All patients with Huntington's disease exhibited significant brain atrophy resulting from volume reductions in both cortical and subcortical grey matter. Atrophy of the cortex was relatively uniform, although the medial temporal lobe structures were spared. The caudate nucleus and putamen were strikingly reduced in all cases and this atrophy correlated with the severity of cortical atrophy, suggesting an associated disease process. The rate of cortical but not subcortical atrophy correlated with CAG repeat numbers. Loss of frontal white matter correlated with both cortical and striatal atrophy. Age of onset of chorea correlated with the amount of subcortical atrophy, while duration of chorea correlated negatively with atrophy of the white matter. These results suggest a more widespread and global disease process in patients with Huntington's disease.},

abstract = {In vivo MRI-derived measurements of human cerebral cortex thickness are providing novel insights into normal and abnormal neuroanatomy, but little is known about their reliability. We investigated how the reliability of cortical thickness measurements is affected by MRI instrument-related factors, including scanner field strength, manufacturer, upgrade and pulse sequence. Several data processing factors were also studied. Two test-retest data sets were analyzed: 1) 15 healthy older subjects scanned four times at 2-week intervals on three scanners; 2) 5 subjects scanned before and after a major scanner upgrade. Within-scanner variability of global cortical thickness measurements was <0.03 mm, and the point-wise standard deviation of measurement error was approximately 0.12 mm. Variability was 0.15 mm and 0.17 mm in average, respectively, for cross-scanner (Siemens/GE) and cross-field strength (1.5 T/3 T) comparisons. Scanner upgrade did not increase variability nor introduce bias. Measurements across field strength, however, were slightly biased (thicker at 3 T). The number of (single vs. multiple averaged) acquisitions had a negligible effect on reliability, but the use of a different pulse sequence had a larger impact, as did different parameters employed in data processing. Sample size estimates indicate that regional cortical thickness difference of 0.2 mm between two different groups could be identified with as few as 7 subjects per group, and a difference of 0.1 mm could be detected with 26 subjects per group. These results demonstrate that MRI-derived cortical thickness measures are highly reliable when MRI instrument and data processing factors are controlled but that it is important to consider these factors in the design of multi-site or longitudinal studies, such as clinical drug trials.},

Subject-specific growth modeling, cross-sectional atlas-building and growth modeling in atlas space are combined with statistical longitudinal modeling, resulting in a longitudi- nal diffusion tensor atlas. The method captures changes in morphology, while modeling temporal changes and allowing to account for covari- ates. The component algorithms are based on large-displacement metric mapping formulations. To effectively account for measurements sparse in time, a continuous-discrete growth model is proposed. The method is applied to a longitudinal dataset of diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance brain images of developing macaque monkeys with time-points at ages 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.},

The algorithm uses the three invariants of the raw water spin self-diffusion tensor represented by a 3 x 3 positive definite matrix and certain math functions that do not require iteration. The implementation requires a positive definite mask to preserve the physical meaning of the eigenvalues. This algorithm can increase the speed of eigenvalue/eigenvector calculations by a factor of 5-40 over standard iterative Jacobi or singular-value decomposition techniques. This approach may accelerate the computation of eigenvalues, eigenvalue-dependent metrics, and eigenvectors especially when having high-resolution measurements with large numbers of slices and large fields of view.},

abstract = {White matter microstructural integrity was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 25 young adults, 25 nondemented older adults, and 25 age-matched older adults with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). For each individual, measures of anisotropy and diffusivity were obtained from atlas-transformed images in the anterior and posterior callosum and in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital white matter. These data revealed age differences in anisotropy and diffusivity in all assessed regions. Age effects were greater in the anterior as opposed to the posterior corpus callosum and greater in the frontal white matter than in the temporal, parietal and occipital white matter, suggesting age-associated differences in white matter that exhibit a roughly anterior-to-posterior gradient. In contrast, individuals with early-stage dementia exhibited minimal, if any, additional change in anterior regions but did show greater deterioration of white matter in posterior lobar regions. Taken collectively, these results indicate that nondemented aging is characterized by significant changes in white matter most prominently in anterior brain regions. The dissociation between the regional effects of age and dementia status suggests that the mechanisms underlying age-associated cognitive decline are likely distinct from those underlying DAT.},

abstract = {During the first years of symptomatic Huntington's disease (HD), no readily apparent pathology is seen in the neostriatum at autopsy. To investigate the pathological correlates of chorea and other early clinical signs, we examined the evolution of neuronal loss and accompanying astrocytosis in neostriatal tissue from autopsy cases of early HD. We found scattered islands of astrocytosis and neuronal loss that were present before the previously described ventrally progressive wave of generalized neuronal loss. Histological demonstration of these islands, which are apparently specific to HD, is very helpful in the pathological differential diagnosis of this disease. Immunocytochemical stains for glial fibrillary acidic protein and for markers of the neostriatal striosome-matrix system showed that these islands correspond to the striosome compartment. Striosomal neuronal loss was present throughout the dorsoventral extent of the caudate nucleus and putamen during the early phase of symptomatic disease, and this loss extended to the most ventral region of the nucleus accumbens in later stages. Analysis of the functional circuitry of the basal ganglia suggests that early degeneration of striosomal neurons may produce hyperactivity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, causing chorea and other early clinical manifestations of HD.},

In contrast, the HD patients were significantly worse, and showed a more rapid decline on the letter fluency test, a task especially sensitive to deficiencies in retrieval. The HD patients were also more impaired than DAT patients on a vocabulary test and on copying geometric figures.

@article{Holmes1996,
abstract = {The analysis of functional mapping experiments in positron emission tomography involves the formation of images displaying the values of a suitable statistic, summarising the evidence in the data for a particular effect at each voxel. These statistic images must then be scrutinised to locate regions showing statistically significant effects. The methods most commonly used are parametric, assuming a particular form of probability distribution for the voxel values in the statistic image. Scientific hypotheses, formulated in terms of parameters describing these distributions, are then tested on the basis of the assumptions. Images of statistics are usually considered as lattice representations of continuous random fields. These are more amenable to statistical analysis. There are various shortcomings associated with these methods of analysis. The many assumptions and approximations involved may not be true. The low numbers of subjects and scans, in typical experiments, lead to noisy statistic images with low degrees of freedom, which are not well approximated by continuous random fields. Thus, the methods are only approximately valid at best and are most suspect in single-subject studies. In contrast to the existing methods, we present a nonparametric approach to significance testing for statistic images from activation studies. Formal assumptions are replaced by a computationally expensive approach. In a simple rest-activation study, if there is really no activation effect, the labelling of the scans as "active" or "rest" is artificial, and a statistic image formed with some other labelling is as likely as the observed one. Thus, considering all possible relabellings, a p value can be computed for any suitable statistic describing the statistic image. Consideration of the maximal statistic leads to a simple nonparametric single-threshold test. This randomisation test relies only on minimal assumptions about the design of the experiment, is (almost) exact, with Type I error (almost) exactly that specified, and hence is always valid. The absence of distributional assumptions permits the consideration of a wide range of test statistics, for instance, "pseudo" t statistic images formed with smoothed variance images. The approach presented extends easily to other paradigms, permitting nonparametric analysis of most functional mapping experiments. When the assumptions of the parametric methods are true, these new nonparametric methods, at worst, provide for their validation. When the assumptions of the parametric methods are dubious, the nonparametric methods provide the only analysis that can be guaranteed valid and exact.},

However, major dense lines were sporadically observed; (2) the myelin sheath was not generally formed by spiralling of one cytoplasmic process of the oligodendroglia, but by enclosing an axon with several stratified layers of cytoplasmic sheets, some of which were certainly formed by the splitting of one process; and (3) aberrant myelination frequently occurred around the soma of oligodendroglia, not related to any axons.},

abstract = {The accuracy of single diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) measurements depends upon the encoding scheme used. In this study, the diffusion tensor accuracy of several strategies for DT-MRI encoding are compared. The encoding strategies are based upon heuristic, numerically optimized, and regular polyhedra schemes. The criteria for numerical optimization include the minimum tensor variance (MV), minimum force (MF), minimum potential energy (ME), and minimum condition number. The regular polyhedra scheme includes variations of the icosahedron. Analytical comparisons and Monte Carlo simulations show that the icosahedron scheme is optimum for six encoding directions. The MV, MF, and ME solutions for six directions are functionally equivalent to the icosahedron scheme. Two commonly used heuristic DT-MRI encoding schemes with six directions, which are based upon the geometric landmarks of a cube (vertices, edge centers, and face centers), are found to be suboptimal. For more than six encoding directions, many methods are able to generate a set of equivalent optimum encoding directions including the regular polyhedra, and the ME, MF and MV numerical optimization solutions. For seven directions, a previously described heuristic encoding scheme (tetrahedral plus x, y, z) was also found to be optimum. This study indicates that there is no significant advantage to using more than six encoding directions as long as an optimum encoding is used for six directions. Future DT-MRI studies are necessary to validate these observations. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:769-780.},

@article{Jensen2005,
abstract = {A magnetic resonance imaging method is presented for quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter, reflecting the structural differences between these two types of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.},

abstract = {Using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and morphometric techniques, groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) were compared with a large group of normal control subjects. Measures of volume loss in specific subcortical nuclei and eight cortical regions as well as an index of white matter abnormality were obtained. Results indicated expected widespread cortical volume reductions in AD, which were especially severe in mesial cortices; but comparable reductions were present in subcortical structures, particularly the thaiamus. In HD, the greatest reductions were in striatal structures, but significant abnormalities were also detected in the \~{},halamus and inferior cortical areas, especially in mesial temporal lobe strttctures. Significant degen- eration in white matter was present in both groups, but was more dramatic in the HD patients. The significant diencephalic reduction in AD may make an important contribution to early memory deficits in the disorder, which are usually attributed to hippocampc! damage. Similarly, damage to both the thalamus and mesial temporal lobe structures may play a role in the memory deficits of HD.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) permits determination of the dominant orientation of structured tissue within an image voxel. This has led to the development of 2D graphical methods for representing fiber orientation and DT-MRI "tractography," which aims to reconstruct the 3D trajectories of white matter fasciculi. Most contemporary fiber orientation mapping schemes and tractography algorithms employ the directional information contained in the eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor to approximate white matter fiber orientation. However, while the uncertainty associated with every estimate of an eigenvector has long been recognized, no attempts to quantify this uncertainty in vivo have been reported. Here, a method is proposed for determining confidence intervals in fiber orientation from real DT-MRI data using the bootstrap method. This is used to construct maps of the "cone of uncertainty," allowing simultaneous viewing of fiber orientation and its uncertainty, and to examine the relationship between orientation uncertainty and tissue anisotropy.},

abstract = {There are conflicting opinions in the literature as to whether it is more beneficial to use a large number of gradient sampling orientations in diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) experiments than to use a smaller number of carefully chosen orientations. In this study, Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the effect of using different gradient sampling schemes on estimates of tensor-derived quantities assuming a b-value of 1000 smm(-2). The study focused in particular on the effect that the number of unique gradient orientations has on uncertainty in estimates of tensor-orientation, and on estimates of the trace and anisotropy of the diffusion tensor. The results challenge the recently proposed notion that a set of six icosahedrally-arranged orientations is optimal for DT-MRI. It is shown that at least 20 unique sampling orientations are necessary for a robust estimation of anisotropy, whereas at least 30 unique sampling orientations are required for a robust estimation of tensor-orientation and mean diffusivity. Finally, the performance of sampling schemes that use low numbers of sampling orientations, but make efficient use of available gradient power, are compared to less efficient schemes with larger numbers of sampling orientations, and the relevant scenarios in which each type of scheme should be used are discussed.},

abstract = {Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has been increasingly used in imaging neuroscience over the last decade. An early form of this technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was rapidly implemented by major MRI scanner companies as a scanner selling point. Due to the ease of use of such implementations, and the plausibility of some of their results, DTI was leapt on by imaging neuroscientists who saw it as a powerful and unique new tool for exploring the structural connectivity of human brain. However, DTI is a rather approximate technique, and its results have frequently been given implausible interpretations that have escaped proper critique and have appeared misleadingly in journals of high reputation. In order to encourage the use of improved DW-MRI methods, which have a better chance of characterizing the actual fiber structure of white matter, and to warn against the misuse and misinterpretation of DTI, we review the physics of DW-MRI, indicate currently preferred methodology, and explain the limits of interpretation of its results. We conclude with a list of 'Do's and Don'ts' which define good practice in this expanding area of imaging neuroscience.},

@article{Kabus2004,
abstract = {B-splines are a well-known approach for non-rigid image registration. Though successfully applied to various medical applications they exhibit a high computational complexity mainly because of the lack of dedicated optimization methods. In this work we focus on a Levenberg-Marquardt type optimization routine. As a similarity measure we use least-squares functionals such as the sum of squared differences, the cross-correlation and the local correlation measure, respectively. The latter is used for multi-modality registration tasks. The proposed registration algorithm consists of three main parts. In each iteration step one has to (a) build a linear system of equations, (b) solve this system and compute an update, (c) determine the step length for the following iteration step. Appropriate stopping criteria ensure the termination of the registration task. A standard approach for (c) and several modifications are investigated. Using a quadratic model we are able to avoid additional execution of (b) during the step length adaption. Several solvers (Cholesky, CG, pre-conditioning) for (b) have been evaluated. Also, modifications on the most time consuming task (a) are investigated, leading to a speed-up by a factor up to 30. Finally, the algorithm is embedded in a multi-scale framework (both on image and on parameter level) providing additional regularization, an increased capture range and speed-up. Convergence tests have been successfully applied for a priori known transformations. Feasibility of the proposed approach is also shown for clinical applications including PET-CT registrations (19 data sets) and MR mammography.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease is caused by a known genetic mutation and so potentially can be diagnosed many years before the onset of symptoms. Neuropathological changes have been found in both striatum and frontal cortex in the pre-symptomatic stage. Disruption of cortico-striatal white matter fibre tracts is therefore likely to contribute to the first clinical signs of the disease. We analysed diffusion tensor MR image (DTI) data from 25 pre-symptomatic gene carriers (PSCs) and 20 matched controls using a multivariate support vector machine to identify patterns of changes in fractional anisotropy (FA). In addition, we performed probabilistic fibre tracking to detect changes in 'streamlines' connecting frontal cortex to striatum. We found a pattern of structural brain changes that includes putamen bilaterally as well as anterior parts of the corpus callosum. This pattern was sufficiently specific to enable us to correctly classify 82\% of scans as coming from a PSC or control subject. Fibre tracking revealed a reduction of frontal cortico-fugal streamlines reaching the body of the caudate in PSCs compared to controls. In the left hemispheres of PSCs we found a negative correlation between years to estimated disease onset and streamlines from frontal cortex to body of caudate. A large proportion of the fibres to the caudate body originate from the frontal eye fields, which play an important role in the control of voluntary saccades. This type of saccade is specifically impaired in PSCs and is an early clinical sign of motor abnormalities. A correlation analysis in 14 PSCs revealed that subjects with greater impairment of voluntary-guided saccades had fewer fibre tracking streamlines connecting the frontal cortex and caudate body. Our findings suggest a specific patho-physiological basis for these symptoms by indicating selective vulnerability of the associated white matter tracts.},

abstract = {Reconstruction of neuronal fibers using diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is an emerging method in biomedical research. Existing fiber-tracking algorithms are commonly based on the "walker principle." Fibers are reconstructed as trajectories of "walkers," which are guided according to local diffusion properties. In this study, a new method of fiber tracking is proposed that does not engage any "walking" algorithm. It resolves a number of inherent problems of the "walking" approach, in particular the reconstruction of crossing and spreading fibers. In the proposed method, the fibers are built with small line elements. Each line element contributes an anisotropic term to the simulated DW signal, which is adjusted to the measured signal. This method demonstrates good results for simulated fibers. A single in vivo result demonstrates the successful reconstruction of the dominant neuronal pathways. A comparison with the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based fiber assignment with continuous tracking (FACT) method and the probabilistic index of connectivity (PICo) method based on a multitensor model is performed for the callosal fibers. The result shows a strong increase in the number of reconstructed fibers. These almost fill the total white matter (WM) volume and connect a large area of the cortex. The method is very computationally expensive. Possible ways to address this problem are discussed.},

There are a large number of parallel reconstruction algorithms; this article reviews a cross-section, SENSE, SMASH, g-SMASH and GRAPPA, selected to demonstrate the different approaches. Theoretical (the g-factor) and practical (coil design) limits to acquisition speed are reviewed. The practical implementation of parallel imaging is also discussed, in particular coil calibration. How to recognize potential failure modes and their associated artefacts are shown. Well-established applications including angiography, cardiac imaging and applications using echo planar imaging are reviewed and we discuss what makes a good application for parallel imaging. Finally, active research areas where parallel imaging is being used to improve data quality by repairing artefacted images are also reviewed.},

abstract = {Eighteen patients with early Huntington's disease were compared with age- and IQ-matched control volunteers on tests of executive and mnemonic function taken from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Tests of pattern and spatial recognition memory, spatial span, spatial working memory, spatial planning and visual discrimination learning/attentional set shifting were employed. These tests have previously been found to be sensitive to the later stages of Huntington's disease. Patients with early Huntington's disease were found to have a wide range of cognitive impairments encompassing both visuospatial memory and executive functions, a pattern distinct from those seen in other basal ganglia disorders. In contrast to patients with more advanced Huntington's disease, early Huntington's disease patients were not impaired at simple reversal learning, but were impaired at performing an extradimensional shift (EDS). The results will be discussed in relation to the hypothesized neuropathological staging of Huntington's disease and to the anatomical connectivity of the striatum.},

abstract = {The performance of 54 subjects genetically at risk for Huntington's disease was examined in double-blind fashion on a series of computerized tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. None of the subjects exhibited clinical movement disorder characteristic of Huntington's disease. Of the 54 subjects, 22 were Huntington's disease mutation carriers and 32 were non-carriers. On a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests previously shown to be sensitive to the early stages of clinical Huntington's disease, Huntington's disease mutation carriers exhibited highly specific cognitive deficits. In particular, Huntington's disease mutation carriers performed significantly less well than non-carriers, matched for age and IQ, on tests of attentional set shifting and semantic verbal fluency. Furthermore, performance on these two tests was significantly correlated, even after partialling out the effects of age and IQ. It is suggested that these cognitive impairments relate to a common deficit in inhibitory control mechanisms, under the control of striatofrontal mechanisms, and that such a deficit is present in Huntington's disease mutation carriers prior to the onset of definite motor symptomatology. The implications for the nature of the cognitive decline seen in Huntington's disease, and possible future treatment strategies, are discussed.},

abstract = {White matter tractography using diffusion tensor MR images is a promising method for estimating the pathways of white matter tracts in the human brain. The success of this method ultimately depends upon the accuracy of the white matter tractography algorithms. In this study, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to investigate the impact of SNR, tensor anisotropy, and diffusion tensor encoding directions on the accuracy of six tractography algorithms. The accuracy was assessed in straight and curved tracts and tract geometries with divergence properties. In general, the tract dispersion increased with distance and decreased with SNR and anisotropy. The tract orientation with respect to the encoding scheme also influenced tract dispersion. Divergent tract geometries increased tract dispersion, whereas convergent tract geometries reduced dispersion. Analytic models of tract dispersion were constructed as a function of the tract distance, SNR, eigenvalues of the tracts, voxel size, and the relationship between the tract direction and the diffusion tensor encoding directions. In certain cases, the mean tract trajectory was found to deviate from the ideal pathway for curved trajectories. Analytical models of mean displacement were constructed as a function of the curvature, tract distance, step size, and tensor eigenvalues. These models may be used in future studies to assess the level of confidence associated with a tractography result.},

abstract = {The diffusion tensor (DT) is a three-dimensional (3D) model of diffusivity in biological tissues. In white matter (WM), the major eigenvector, which is the direction of greatest diffusivity, is generally assumed to align with the direction of the fiber bundles. The distribution of major eigenvectors in WM has been investigated using color-based maps and WM tractography (WMT). However, anatomical patterns in the medium and minor eigenvector directions have largely been ignored in DTI studies of the human brain. In this study, the patterns of medium and minor eigenvectors in the brain were investigated using both color-based maps and WMT. Specific WM structures, such as the corona radiata, internal and external capsules, sagittal stratum, cingulum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus, demonstrated coherent patterns in the medium and minor eigenvector directions. These patterns were consistent across subjects. The orthogonal or axial diffusion asymmetry may be explained by merging, diverging, or crossing fiber geometries. The effects of orthogonal diffusion asymmetry on WMT were also investigated. This study shows that WM axial asymmetry causes anisotropic dispersion patterns in the estimated tract trajectories. The medium and minor eigenvector patterns may be useful for elucidating the local dispersion distributions of WM tracts.},

abstract = {Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has become an important MRI procedure to investigate the integrity of white matter in brain in vivo. DTI is estimated from a series of acquired Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) volumes. DWI data suffers from inherent low SNR, overall long scanning time of multiple directional encoding with correspondingly large risk to encounter several kinds of artifacts. These artifacts can be too severe for a correct and stable estimation of the diffusion tensor. Thus, a quality control (QC) procedure is absolutely necessary for DTI studies. Currently, routine DTI QC procedures are conducted manually by visually checking the DWI data set in a gradient by gradient and slice by slice way. The results often suffer from low consistence across different data sets, lack of agreement of different experts, and difficulty to judge motion artifacts by qualitative inspection. Additionally considerable manpower is needed for this step due to the large number of images to QC, which is common for group comparison and longitudinal studies, especially with increasing number of diffusion gradient directions. We present a framework for automatic DWI QC. We developed a tool called DTIPrep which pipelines the QC steps with a detailed protocoling and reporting facility. And it is fully open source. This framework/tool has been successfully applied to several DTI studies with several hundred DWIs in our lab as well as collaborating labs in Utah and Iowa. In our studies, the tool provides a crucial piece for robust DTI analysis in brain white matter study.},

abstract = {Morphometric studies of the tail of the caudate nucleus, the site where the pathology is first seen, were performed on 16 brain specimens collected from individuals at risk for inheriting Huntington’s disease (HD). Medical records and infor- mation obtained from immediate family members indicated that all had died without symptoms of HD. Six individuals had 37 or more CAG repeats and were designated HD gene carriers, whereas 10 were determined to be non-carriers. Cell counts of the tail of the caudate nucleus revealed an increased density of oligodendrocytes among the presymptomatic HD gene carriers (mean cells/field: carriers = 40.0, noncarrier = 21.3; age, sex, repeated measure adjusted F[126] = 11.7, p = 0.0008). No statistically significant differences were found between HD carriers and noncarriers in the density of neurons (carriers = 16.9, noncarriers = 15.5), astrocytes (carriers = 27.8, noncarriers = 21.3) or microglial cells (carriers = 7.9, noncarriers = 5.6). Ubiquitin immunostaining performed in 3 gene carriers revealed intranuclear in- clusions in all 3 cases, including 1, with 37 repeats, who died 3 decades before the expected age for onset of the clinical syndrome. Normal densities of other cell types and careful macroscopic examination suggest that the increase in oligo- dendroglial density is not a consequence of atrophy and may instead reflect a developmental effect of the HD gene.},

Thirty-one preclinical gene-mutation carriers were imaged cross-sectionally using diffusion tensor and anatomical brain imaging. Subjects were individuals who had a known gene mutation for HD but did not manifest motor diagnostic criteria for HD. Fractional anisotropy scalar maps showed a positive correlation with five year probability of diagnosis (based upon gene repeat length and current age) in the putamen and a negative correlation in the external capsule. This study shows that scalar maps generated from diffusion tensor imaging may be directly related to the earliest stages of disease progression within HD, even before a diagnosis is given. Findings suggest that DTI measures, therefore, may have the ability to act as a biomarker for disease progression in clinical trials of pre-manifest subjects.},

Repeated measures were obtained across two imaging protocols allowing intra-subject and inter-site variability to be assessed. Regional measures within white matter were obtained for standard rotationally invariant measures: fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity. Intra-subject coefficient of variation was typically less than 1\% for all scalars and regions. Inter-site coefficient of variation increased to approximately 1-3\%. Inter-vendor variation was similar to inter-site variability. This variability includes differences in the actual implementation of the sequence.},

abstract = {Intense efforts are underway to evaluate neuroimaging measures as biomarkers for neurodegeneration in premanifest Huntington's disease (preHD). We used a completely automated longitudinal analysis method to compare structural scans in preHD individuals and controls. Using a 1-year longitudinal design, we analyzed T(1) -weighted structural scans in 35 preHD individuals and 22 age-matched controls. We used the SIENA (Structural Image Evaluation, using Normalization, of Atrophy) software tool to yield overall percentage brain volume change (PBVC) and voxel-level changes in atrophy. We calculated sample sizes for a hypothetical disease-modifying (neuroprotection) study. We found significantly greater yearly atrophy in preHD individuals versus controls (mean PBVC controls, -0.149\%; preHD, -0.388\%; P = .031, Cohen's d = .617). For a preHD subgroup closest to disease onset, yearly atrophy was more than 3 times that of controls (mean PBVC close-to-onset preHD, -0.510\%; P = .019, Cohen's d = .920). This atrophy was evident at the voxel level in periventricular regions, consistent with well-established preHD basal ganglia atrophy. We estimated that a neuroprotection study using SIENA would only need 74 close-to-onset individuals in each arm (treatment vs placebo) to detect a 50\% slowing in yearly atrophy with 80\% power. Automated whole-brain analysis of structural MRI can reliably detect preHD disease progression in 1 year.

@article{Majid2011a,
abstract = {Future clinical trials of neuroprotection in prodromal Huntington's (known as preHD) will require sensitive in vivo imaging biomarkers to track disease progression over the shortest period. Since basal ganglia atrophy is the most prominent structural characteristic of Huntington's pathology, systematic assessment of longitudinal subcortical atrophy holds great potential for future biomarker development. We studied 36 preHD and 22 age-matched controls using a novel method to quantify regional change from T(1) -weighted structural images acquired 1 year apart. We assessed cross-sectional volume differences and longitudinal volumetric change in 7 subcortical structures-the accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus. At baseline, accumbens, caudate, pallidum, and putamen volumes were reduced in preHD versus controls (all P < .01). Longitudinally, atrophy was greater in preHD than controls in the caudate, pallidum, and putamen (all P < .01). Each structure showed a large between-group effect size, especially the pallidum where Cohen's d was 1.21. Using pallidal atrophy as a biomarker, we estimate that a hypothetical 1-year neuroprotection study would require only 35 preHD per arm to detect a 50\% slowing in atrophy and only 138 preHD per arm to detect a 25\% slowing in atrophy. The effect sizes calculated for preHD basal ganglia atrophy over 1 year are some of the largest reported to date. Consequently, this translates to strikingly small sample size estimates that will greatly facilitate any future neuroprotection study. This underscores the utility of this automatic image segmentation and longitudinal nonlinear registration method for upcoming studies of preHD and other neurodegenerative disorders.},

abstract = {The anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) is a white matter structure, the medial portion of which includes the anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) carrying nerve fibers between thalamus and prefrontal cortex. ATR abnormalities have a possible link with cognitive abnormalities and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. We aimed to study the fiber integrity of the ATR more selectively by isolating the medial portion of the ALIC using region-of-interest based methodology. Diffusion-tensor imaging was used to measure the anisotropy of total ALIC (tALIC) and medial ALIC (mALIC) in 39 schizophrenia and 33 control participants, matched for age/gender/handedness. Relationships between anisotropy, psychopathology, and cognitive performance were analyzed. Compared with controls, schizophrenia participants had 4.55\% lower anisotropy in right tALIC, and 5.38\% lower anisotropy in right mALIC. There were no significant group anisotropy differences on the left. Significant correlations were observed between right ALIC integrity and relevant domains of cognitive function (e.g., executive function, working memory). Our study suggests an asymmetric microstructural change in ALIC in schizophrenia involving the right side, which is only minimally stronger in mALIC, and which correlates with cognitive impairment. Microstructural changes in the ALIC may be linked to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Follow-up imaging studies require the evaluation of the anatomical changes over time for specific clinical groups. The longitudinal changes for a specific subject can be evaluated through the non-rigid registration of successive anatomical images. However, to perform a longitudinal group-wise analysis, the subject-specific longitudinal trajectories of anatomical points need to be transported in a common reference frame. In this work, we propose the Schild's Ladder framework as an effective method to transport longitudinal deformations in time series of images in a common space using diffeomorphic registration. We illustrate the computational advantages and demonstrate the numerical accuracy of this very simple method by comparing with standard methods of transport on simulated images with progressing brain atrophy. Finally, its application to the clinical problem of the measurement of the longitudinal progression in the Alzheimer's disease suggests that an important gain in sensitivity could be expected on group-wise comparisons.},

Damage to these structures result in movement disorders such as in Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease, or behavioural disorders such as Tourette syndrome. In this paper, we propose to study the connectivity profile of the deep nuclei to the motor, associative or limbic areas and we introduce a novel tool to build a probabilistic atlas of these connections to the cortex directly on the surface of the cortical mantel, as it corresponds to the space of functional interest. The tool is then applied on two populations of healthy volunteers and patients suffering from severe Huntington's disease to produce two surface atlases of the connectivity of the basal ganglia to the cortical areas. Finally, robust statistics are used to characterize the differences of that connectivity between the two populations, providing new connectivity-based biomarkers of the pathology.},

abstract = {Despite electrostimulation studies of the white matter pathways, supporting the role of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) in semantic processing, little is known about the precise anatomical course of this fascicle, especially regarding its exact cortical terminations. Here, in the lights of these new functional data, we dissected 14 post-mortem human hemispheres using the Klingler fiber dissection technique, to study the IFOF fibers and to identify their actual cortical terminations in the parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. We identified two different components of the IFOF: (i) a superficial and dorsal subcomponent, which connects the frontal lobe with the superior parietal lobe and the posterior portion of the superior and middle occipital gyri, (ii) a deep and ventral subcomponent, which connects the frontal lobe with the posterior portion of the inferior occipital gyrus and the posterior temporo-basal area. Thus, our results are in line with the hypothesis of the functional role of the IFOF in the semantic system, by showing that it is mainly connected with two areas involved in semantics: the occipital associative extrastriate cortex and the temporo-basal region. Further combined anatomical (dissection and Diffusion Tensor Imaging) and functional (intraoperative subcortical stimulation) studies are needed, to clarify the exact participation of each IFOF subcomponent in semantic processing.},

abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with no effective disease-modifying treatments. There is considerable interest in finding reliable indicators of disease progression to judge the efficacy of novel treatments that slow or stop disease onset before debilitating signs appear. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) may provide a reliable marker of disease progression by characterizing diffusivity changes in white matter (WM) in individuals with prodromal HD. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) may play a role in HD progression due to its prominent striatal connections and documented role in executive function. This study uses DWI to characterize diffusivity in specific regions of PFC WM defined by FreeSurfer in 53 prodromal HD participants and 34 controls. Prodromal HD individuals were separated into three CAG-Age Product (CAP) groups (16 low, 22 medium, 15 high) that indexed baseline progression. Statistically significant increases in mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) among CAP groups relative to controls were seen in inferior and lateral PFC regions. For MD and RD, differences among controls and HD participants tracked with baseline disease progression. The smallest difference was for the low group and the largest for the high group. Significant correlations between Trail Making Test B (TMTB) and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and/or RD paralleled group differences in mean MD and/or RD in several right hemisphere regions. The gradient of effects that tracked with CAP group suggests DWI may provide markers of disease progression in future longitudinal studies as increasing diffusivity abnormalities in the lateral PFC of prodromal HD individuals.

Inherent differences in the two imaging protocols produce significant nonrigid motion between the two acquisitions. A rigid body deformation combined with localized cubic B-splines is used to capture this motion. The deformation is defined on a regular grid and is parameterized by potentially several thousand coefficients. Together with a spline-based continuous representation of images and Parzen histogram estimates, our deformation model allows closed-form expressions for the criterion and its gradient. A limited-memory quasi-Newton optimization algorithm is used in a hierarchical multiresolution framework to automatically align the images. To characterize the performance of the method, 27 scans from patients involved in routine lung cancer staging were used in a validation study. The registrations were assessed visually by two expert observers in specific anatomic locations using a split window validation technique. The visually reported errors are in the 0- to 6-mm range and the average computation time is 100 min on a moderate-performance workstation.},

@article{Mattiello1997,
abstract = {In diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) an effective diffusion tensor in each voxel is measured by using a set of diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) in which diffusion gradients are applied in a multiplicity of oblique directions. However, to estimate the diffusion tensor accurately, one must account for the effects of all imaging and diffusion gradient pulses on each signal echo, which are embodied in the b matrix. For DTI to be practical clinically, one must also acquire DWIs rapidly and free of motion artifacts, which is now possible with diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DW-EPI). An analytical expression for the b matrix of a general DW-EPI pulse sequence is presented and then validated experimentally by measuring the diffusion tensor in an isotropic phantom whose diffusivity is already known. The b matrix is written in a convenient tabular form as a sum of individual pair-wise contributions arising from gradient pulses applied along parallel and perpendicular directions. While the contributions from readout and phase-encode gradient pulse trains are predicted to have a negligible effect on the echo, the contributions from other imaging and diffusion gradient pulses applied in both parallel and orthogonal directions are shown to be significant in our sequence. In general, one must understand and account for the multiplicity of interactions between gradient pulses and the echo signal to ensure that diffusion tensor imaging is quantitative.},

abstract = {The anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AV) has a role in spatial memory, but the influence of the prominent brainstem cholinergic projection to this region is unknown. Here, spatial memory in a 12-arm radial maze was examined after 0.15 microl bilateral AV infusions of scopolamine. In part one, rats visited six arms singly (the phase 1 arms) and, after a 10 min delay, were allowed free choice to both phase 1 arms and the remaining six baited arms (phase 2 arms). Scopolamine (10 microg) administered during the delay increased errors to both phase 1 and phase 2 arms, whereas PBS infusions increased phase 1 arm errors only. The PBS effect was the result of inserting the internal cannulas alone and not the infusion. The same dose of scopolamine (10 microg) infused before maze testing (part two: no phase 1 arms, no delay) also impaired spatial memory over and above the effects of both PBS and no-infusion, which did not differ markedly. Part two also showed that choice latency and choice strategies were unaffected by PBS and scopolamine. Cannulation and infusion procedures in both parts one and two did not produce any negative carryover effects across multiple control (no internal cannula) sessions, and a trypan blue manipulation indicated that infusions were restricted to the AV region. This study provides the first direct evidence that the brainstem cholinergic innervation to the limbic thalamus influences learning and memory, which may have important implications for human neurological conditions such as alcohol-related disorders and schizophrenia.},

Regions-of-interest (ROIs) in cortical gray (CG) and white matter in the internal capsule (IC) were selected for ADC decay curve analyses using a biexponential fitting model over this extended b-factor range. Measures of the fast and slow ADC component amplitudes and the traces of the fast and slow diffusion coefficients were obtained from CG and IC ROIs in both adults and newborns. The ADC decay curves from the newborn brain regions were found to have a significantly higher fraction of the fast diffusion ADC component than corresponding regions in the adult brain. The results demonstrate that post-natal brain development has a profound affect on the biexponential parameters which characterize the decay of water signal over an extended b-factor range in both gray and white matter.},

To this end, we studied by 3T MRI: 18 early affected, 22 premanifest gene-positive subjects, 23 healthy controls (50 slices of 2.3 mm thickness per volume, 64 diffusion-weighted directions (b = 1000 s/mm2), 8 minimal diffusion-weighting (b = 100 s/mm2)); and by 1.5 T imaging: 29 premanifest HD, 30 controls (40 axial slices of 2.3 mm thickness per volume, 61 diffusion-weighted directions (b = 1000 s/mm2), minimal diffusion-weighting (b = 100 s/mm2)). An outlier based method was developed to identify movement and other sources of noise by comparing the index DWI direction against a weighted average computed from all other directions of the same subject. No significant differences were observed when separately comparing each group of patients with and without removal of DWI volumes that contained artifacts. In line with previous DWI-based studies, decreased FA in the corpus callosum and increased FA around the basal ganglia were observed when premanifest mutation carriers and early affected patients were compared with healthy controls. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the FA value in the presence of movement and thus encourage multi-center imaging studies in HD.},

abstract = {The signal decay with increasing b-factor at fixed echo time from brain tissue in vivo has been measured using a line scan Stejskal-Tanner spin echo diffusion approach in eight healthy adult volunteers. The use of a 175 ms echo time and maximum gradient strengths of 10 mT/m allowed 64 b-factors to be sampled, ranging from 5 to 6000 s/ mm2, a maximum some three times larger than that typically used for diffusion imaging. The signal decay with b-factor over this extended range showed a decidedly non-exponential behavior well-suited to biexponential modeling. Statistical analyses of the fitted biexponential parameters from over 125 brain voxels (15 x 15 x 1 mm3 volume) per volunteer yielded a mean volume fraction of 0.74 which decayed with a typical apparent diffusion coefficient around 1.4 microm2/ms. The remaining fraction had an apparent diffusion coefficient of approximately 0.25 microm2/ms. Simple models which might explain the non-exponential behavior, such as intra- and extracellular water compartmentation with slow exchange, appear inadequate for a complete description. For typical diffusion imaging with b-factors below 2000 s/mm2, the standard model of monoexponential signal decay with b-factor, apparent diffusion coefficient values around 0.7 microm2/ms, and a sensitivity to diffusion gradient direction may appear appropriate. Over a more extended but readily accessible b-factor range, however, the complexity of brain signal decay with b-factor increases, offering a greater parametrization of the water diffusion process for tissue characterization.},

@article{Nichols2002,
abstract = {Requiring only minimal assumptions for validity, nonparametric permutation testing provides a flexible and intuitive methodology for the statistical analysis of data from functional neuroimaging experiments, at some computational expense. Introduced into the functional neuroimaging literature by Holmes et al. ([1996]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 16:7-22), the permutation approach readily accounts for the multiple comparisons problem implicit in the standard voxel-by-voxel hypothesis testing framework. When the appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric permutation approach gives results similar to those obtained from a comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a general linear model with multiple comparisons corrections derived from random field theory. For analyses with low degrees of freedom, such as single subject PET/SPECT experiments or multi-subject PET/SPECT or fMRI designs assessed for population effects, the nonparametric approach employing a locally pooled (smoothed) variance estimate can outperform the comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach. Thus, these nonparametric techniques can be used to verify the validity of less computationally expensive parametric approaches. Although the theory and relative advantages of permutation approaches have been discussed by various authors, there has been no accessible explication of the method, and no freely distributed software implementing it. Consequently, there have been few practical applications of the technique. This article, and the accompanying MATLAB software, attempts to address these issues. The standard nonparametric randomization and permutation testing ideas are developed at an accessible level, using practical examples from functional neuroimaging, and the extensions for multiple comparisons described. Three worked examples from PET and fMRI are presented, with discussion, and comparisons with standard parametric approaches made where appropriate. Practical considerations are given throughout, and relevant statistical concepts are expounded in appendices.},

abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is evolving into a potent tool in the examination of the central nervous system. Although it is often used for the detection of acute ischemia, evaluation of directionality in a diffusion measurement can be useful in white matter, which demonstrates strong diffusion anisotropy. Techniques such as diffusion-tensor imaging offer a glimpse into brain microstructure at a scale that is not easily accessible with other modalities, in some cases improving the detection and characterization of white matter abnormalities. Diffusion MR tractography offers an overall view of brain anatomy, including the degree of connectivity between different regions of the brain. However, optimal utilization of the wide range of data provided with directional diffusion MR measurements requires careful attention to acquisition and postprocessing. This article will review the principles of diffusion contrast and anisotropy, as well as clinical applications in psychiatric, developmental, neurodegenerative, neoplastic, demyelinating, and other types of disease.},

Tests of perceptual processing, visual scanning, and attention were primarily associated with Part A, and executive functioning (response inhibition, set-shifting), processing speed, and working memory were associated with Part B. Additionally, TMT scores differentiated between healthy comparisons and prodro- mal HD individuals as far as 9–15 years before estimated diagnosis. In participants manifesting prodromal motor signs and psychiatric symptoms, theTMTprimarily measures cognition and is able to discriminate between groups basedonhealthstatusand estimatedtimetodiagnosis.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate whether neurological symptoms related to a specific axonal fiber tract in brain white matter were associated with a higher degree of tissue damage in that region, in patients at presentation with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis. To this end, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method to segment and evaluate the fiber bundle of interest was implemented, taking care to circumvent the problems caused by pathology. Diffusion tensor (DT) MRI tractography was used to construct, from healthy volunteer data, a probability map for the pyramidal tract (PYT), and this map was applied to patients to calculate DT-derived metrics inside the PYT. In CIS patients with clinical symptoms related to motor function, the DT-derived mean diffusivity and the lesion volume in the PYT were found to be increased, while the fractional anisotropy was no different, when compared to those patients without motor symptoms. These results may be explained by several microstructural changes in the damaged tissue, such as changes in the permeability of axonal cell membranes, decreases of axonal density and edema. The approach taken to analyze a specific fiber tract was possible because the axons in the tract have a high orientational coherence, allowing tissue structure changes to be isolated from the tissue architecture. Its extension to other white matter fiber bundles is therefore limited to bundles with high orientational coherence.},

abstract = {The effective diffusion tensor of water, D, measured by diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI), is inherently a discrete, noisy, voxel-averaged sample of an underlying macroscopic effective diffusion tensor field, D(x). Within fibrous tissues this field is presumed to be continuous and smooth at a gross anatomical length scale. Here a new, general mathematical framework is proposed that uses measured DT-MRI data to produce a continuous approximation to D(x). One essential finding is that the continuous tensor field representation can be constructed by repeatedly performing one-dimensional B-spline transforms of the DT-MRI data. The fidelity and noise-immunity of this approximation are tested using a set of synthetically generated tensor fields to which background noise is added via Monte Carlo methods. Generally, these tensor field templates are reproduced faithfully except at boundaries where diffusion properties change discontinuously or where the tensor field is not microscopically homogeneous. Away from such regions, the tensor field approximation does not introduce bias in useful DT-MRI parameters, such as Trace(D(x)). It also facilitates the calculation of several new parameters, particularly differential quantities obtained from the tensor of spatial gradients of D(x). As an example, we show that they can identify tissue boundaries across which diffusion properties change rapidly using in vivo human brain data. One important application of this methodology is to improve the reliability and robustness of DT-MRI fiber tractography.},

abstract = {This study investigated the properties of a class of rotationally invariant and symmetric (relative to the principal diffusivities) indices of the anisotropy of water self-diffusion, namely fractional anisotropy (FA), relative anisotropy (RA), and volume ratio (VR), with particular emphasis to their measurement in brain tissues. A simplified theoretical analysis predicted significant differences in the sensitivities of the anisotropy indices (AI) over the distribution of the principal diffusivities. Computer simulations were used to investigate the effects on AI image quality of three magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquisition schemes, one being novel: the schemes were simulated on cerebral model fibres varying in shape and spatial orientation. The theoretical predictions and the results of the simulations were corroborated by experimentally determined spatial maps of the AI in a normal feline brain in vivo. We found that FA mapped diffusion anisotropy with the greatest detail and SNR whereas VR provided the strongest contrast between low- and high-anisotropy areas at the expense of increased noise contamination and decreased resolution in anisotropic regions. RA proved intermediate in quality. By sampling the space of the effective diffusion ellipsoid more densely and uniformly and requiring the same total imaging time as the published schemes, the novel DTI scheme achieved greater rotational invariance than the published schemes, with improved noise characteristics, resulting in improved image quality of the AI examined. Our findings suggest that significant improvements in diffusion anisotropy mapping are possible and provide criteria for the selection of the most appropriate AI for a particular application.},

abstract = {Previous MRI studies with participants prior to manifest Huntington disease have been conducted in small single-site samples. The current study reports data from a systematic multi-national study during the prodromal period of Huntington disease and examines whether various brain structures make unique predictions about the proximity to manifest disease. MRI scans were acquired from 657 participants enrolled at 1 of 32 PREDICT-HD research sites. Only prodromal Huntington disease participants (those not meeting motor criteria for diagnosis) were included and subgrouped by estimated diagnosis proximity (Near, Mid, and Far) based upon a formula incorporating age and CAG-repeat length. Results show volumes of all three subgroups differed significantly from Controls for total brain tissue, cerebral spinal fluid, white matter, cortical gray matter, thalamus, caudate, and putamen. Total striatal volume demonstrated the largest differences between Controls and all three prodromal subgroups. Cerebral white matter offered additional independent power in the prediction of estimated proximity to diagnosis. In conclusion, this large cross-sectional study shows that changes in brain volume are detectable years to decades prior to estimated motor diagnosis of Huntington disease. This suggests that a clinical trial of a putative neuroprotective agent could begin as much as 15 years prior to estimated motor diagnosis in a cohort of persons at risk for but not meeting clinical motor diagnostic criteria for Huntington disease, and that neuroimaging (striatal and white matter volumes) may be among the best predictors of diagnosis proximity.},

@article{Perry2011a,
abstract = {Vulnerability to drug abuse is related to both reward seeking and impulsivity, two constructs thought to have a biological basis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This review addresses similarities and differences in neuroanatomy, neurochemistry and behavior associated with PFC function in rodents and humans. Emphasis is placed on monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter systems located in anatomically distinct subregions: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC); anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). While there are complex interconnections and overlapping functions among these regions, each is thought to be involved in various functions related to health-related risk behaviors and drug abuse vulnerability. Among the various functions implicated, evidence suggests that mPFC is involved in reward processing, attention and drug reinstatement; lPFC is involved in decision-making, behavioral inhibition and attentional gating; ACC is involved in attention, emotional processing and self-monitoring; and OFC is involved in behavioral inhibition, signaling of expected outcomes and reward/punishment sensitivity. Individual differences (e.g., age and sex) influence functioning of these regions, which, in turn, impacts drug abuse vulnerability. Implications for the development of drug abuse prevention and treatment strategies aimed at engaging PFC inhibitory processes that may reduce risk-related behaviors are discussed, including the design of effective public service announcements, cognitive exercises, physical activity, direct current stimulation, feedback control training and pharmacotherapies. A major challenge in drug abuse prevention and treatment rests with improving intervention strategies aimed at strengthening PFC inhibitory systems among at-risk individuals.},

abstract = {The BRAINS (Brain Research: Analysis of Images, Networks, and Systems) image analysis software has been in use, and in constant development, for over 20 years. The original neuroimage analysis pipeline using BRAINS was designed as a semiautomated procedure to measure volumes of the cerebral lobes and subcortical structures, requiring manual intervention at several stages in the process. Through use of advanced image processing algorithms the need for manual intervention at stages of image realignment, tissue sampling, and mask editing have been eliminated. In addition, inhomogeneity correction, intensity normalization, and mask cleaning routines have been added to improve the accuracy and consistency of the results. The fully automated method, AutoWorkup, is shown in this study to be more reliable (ICC ≥ 0.96, Jaccard index ≥ 0.80, and Dice index ≥ 0.89 for all tissues in all regions) than the average of 18 manual raters. On a set of 1130 good quality scans, the failure rate for correct realignment was 1.1\%, and manual editing of the brain mask was required on 4\% of the scans. In other tests, AutoWorkup is shown to produce measures that are reliable for data acquired across scanners, scanner vendors, and across sequences. Application of AutoWorkup for the analysis of data from the 32-site, multivendor PREDICT-HD study yield estimates of reliability to be greater than or equal to 0.90 for all tissues and regions.},

In this study of pre-symptomatic carriers of the HD genetic mutation, we have used diffusion tensor imaging to examine the integrity and organization of white matter in a group of individuals who previously demonstrated abnormalities in response to a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm. Our results indicate that, before the onset of manifest HD, there are regional decreases in fractional anisotropy, indicating early white matter disorganization.},

abstract = {Image distortion due to field gradient eddy currents can create image artifacts in diffusion-weighted MR images. These images, acquired by measuring the attenuation of NMR signal due to directionally dependent diffusion, have recently been shown to be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of acute stroke and in mapping of tissue structure. This work presents an improvement on the spin-echo (SE) diffusion sequence that displays less distortion and consequently improves image quality. Adding a second refocusing pulse provides better image quality with less distortion at no cost in scanning efficiency or effectiveness, and allows more flexible diffusion gradient timing. By adjusting the timing of the diffusion gradients, eddy currents with a single exponential decay constant can be nulled, and eddy currents with similar decay constants can be greatly reduced. This new sequence is demonstrated in phantom measurements and in diffusion anisotropy images of normal human brain.},

abstract = {Atrophy of cortical and subcortical gray matter is apparent in Huntington's disease (HD) before symptoms manifest. We hypothesized that the white matter (WM) connecting cortical and subcortical regions must also be affected early and that select clinical symptoms were related to systems degeneration. We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) to examine the regional nature of WM abnormalities in early HD, including the preclinical period, and to determine whether regional changes correlated with clinical features. We studied individuals in early stages (HD), presymptomatic individuals known to carry the genetic mutation that causes HD (Pre-HD), and matched healthy controls. DTI indices of tissue integrity were obtained from several regions of interest, including the corpus callosum (CC), internal capsule (IC), and basal ganglia, were compared across groups by t tests, and were correlated to cognitive and clinical measures. WM alterations were found throughout the CC, in the anterior and posterior limbs of the IC, and in frontal subcortical WM in HD subjects, supporting the selective involvement of the pyramidal tracts in HD; a similar distribution of changes was seen in Pre-HD subjects, supporting presymptomatic alterations. There was a significant relationship between select DTI measures and cognitive performance. Alterations in diffusion indices were also seen in the striatum that were independent of atrophy. Our findings support that WM alterations occur very early in HD. The distribution of the changes suggests that these changes contribute to the disruption of pyramidal and extrapyramidal circuits and also support a role of compromised cortical circuitry in early cognitive and subtle motor impairment during the preclinical stages of HD.},

abstract = {The corpus callosum (CC) is the major conduit for information transfer between the cerebral hemispheres and plays an integral role in relaying sensory, motor and cognitive information between homologous cortical regions. The majority of fibers that make up the CC arise from large pyramidal neurons in layers III and V, which project contra-laterally. These neurons degenerate in Huntington's disease (HD) in a topographically and temporally selective way. Since any focus of cortical degeneration could be expected to secondarily de-afferent homologous regions of cortex, we hypothesized that regionally selective cortical degeneration would be reflected in regionally selective degeneration of the CC. We used conventional T1-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and a modified corpus callosum segmentation scheme to examine the CC in healthy controls, huntingtin gene-carriers and symptomatic HD subjects. We measured mid-sagittal callosal cross-sectional thickness and several DTI parameters, including fractional anisotropy (FA), which reflects the degree of white matter organization, radial diffusivity, a suggested index of myelin integrity, and axial diffusivity, a suggested index of axonal damage of the CC. We found a topologically selective pattern of alterations in these measures in pre-manifest subjects that were more extensive in early symptomatic HD subjects and that correlated with performance on distinct cognitive measures, suggesting an important role for disrupted inter-hemispheric transfer in the clinical symptoms of HD. Our findings provide evidence for early degeneration of commissural pyramidal neurons in the neocortex, loss of cortico-cortical connectivity, and functional compromise of associative cortical processing.},

abstract = {Over the past several years, increased attention has been devoted to understanding regionally selective brain changes that occur in Huntington's disease and their relationships to phenotypic variability. Clinical progression is also heterogeneous, and although CAG repeat length influences age of onset, its role, if any, in progression has been less clear. We evaluated progression in Huntington's disease using a novel longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging analysis. Our hypothesis was that the rate of brain atrophy is influenced by the age of onset of Huntington's disease. We scanned 22 patients with Huntington's disease at approximately 1-year intervals; individuals were divided into 1 of 3 groups, determined by the relative age of onset. We found significant differences in the rates of atrophy of cortex, white matter, and subcortical structures; patients who developed symptoms earlier demonstrated the most rapid rates of atrophy compared with those who developed symptoms during middle age or more advanced age. Rates of cortical atrophy were topologically variable, with the most rapid changes occurring in sensorimotor, posterior frontal, and portions of the parietal cortex. There were no significant differences in the rates of atrophy in basal ganglia structures. Although both CAG repeat length and age influenced the rate of change in some regions, there was no significant correlation in many regions. Rates of regional brain atrophy seem to be influenced by the age of onset of Huntington's disease symptoms and are only partially explained by CAG repeat length. These findings suggest that other genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors play important roles in neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease.},

Regions of compact myelin can be found composed of several layers of alternating major dense lines and intermediate lines repeating with normal periodicity. The "radial component" consisting of periodic thickenings of the intermediate line aligned through several lamellae was also identified. Axoglial junctions characteristic of the type found in paranodal regions are present in greater than normal numbers but occur in aberrant locations. Myelin sheaths have marked reduced numbers of lamellae, which often contain cytoplasm, terminate in cytoplasmic "loops" within and around myelin sheaths, and do not completely encircle axons. In addition, membranous debris appears within neuronal and glial profiles, suggesting some degree of myelin breakdown. Thus, the protein lacks in this mutant appear not to be associated with discrete deficiencies of specific structural components but rather with a variety of quantitative changes and irregularity of form.},

In the diagnostic setting it is necessary to define the limits of the CAG size ranges on normal and HD-associated chromosomes. Most large analyses that defined the limits of the normal and pathological size ranges employed PCR assays, which included the CAG repeats and a CCG repeat tract that was thought to be invariant. Many of these experiments found an overlap between the normal and disease size ranges. Subsequent findings that the CCG repeats vary by 8 trinucleotide lengths suggested that the limits of the normal and disease size ranges should be reevaluated with assays that exclude the CCG polymorphism. Since patients with between 30 and 40 repeats are rare, a consortium was assembled to collect such individuals. All 178 samples were reanalyzed in Cambridge by using assays specific for the CAG repeats. We have optimized methods for reliable sizing of CAG repeats and show cases that demonstrate the dangers of using PCR assays that include both the CAG and CCG polymorphisms. Seven HD patients had 36 repeats, which confirms that this allele is associated with disease. Individuals without apparent symptoms or signs of HD were found at 36 repeats (aged 74, 78, 79, and 87 years), 37 repeats (aged 69 years), 38 repeats (aged 69 and 90 years), and 39 repeats (aged 67, 90, and 95 years). The detailed case histories of an exceptional case from this series will be presented: a 95-year-old man with 39 repeats who did not have classical features of HD. The apparently healthy survival into old age of some individuals with 36-39 repeats suggests that the HD mutation may not always be fully penetrant.},

abstract = {Group-level voxelwise statistical analyses of lesion-deficit relationships have been used to implicate brain structures critical for specific aspects of human cognition and behavior. Current approaches fail to account for the role of fiber tract disruptions in causing deficit, and confound cortical damage with damage to fibers of passage. Here, we develop a framework, Generalized Lesion-Symptom Mapping (GLSM), to integrate fiber tract information from DTI-based tractographic atlases in tractwise and voxelwise lesion-deficit analyses. First, we used the geniculo-calcarine system as a validation testbed. Using logistic regressions we predicted right homonymous visual field deficits in 149 subjects with focal brain damage based on lesion location, with and without incorporating fiber tract information. A probabilistic fiber tract atlas [Wakana S, Jiang H, Nagae-Poetscher LM, Van Zijl PC, Mori S. Fiber tract-based atlas of human white matter anatomy. Radiology 2004;230:77-87] coregistered to our reference brain was used to estimate disconnection to the optic radiations and adjacent fiber tracts. When tract information was not incorporated, lesions in multiple sectors of the temporal lobe were associated with visual field defects. When the optic radiations were incorporated, this artifactual association was eliminated and the calcarine cortex was correctly isolated. Among the incorporated tracts, only the optic radiations significantly predicted visual field defects. Second, we applied the approach to impairments of higher visuoperceptual functions in 111 subjects who were administered the Hooper Visual Organization Test. We included all six association fiber tracts available in the atlas, plus the optic radiations. Tract inclusion narrowed the cortical sectors associated with impaired performance in a manner consistent with recent fMRI findings. The left cingulum and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, significantly predicted impairments. The results demonstrate the viability, validity and value of incorporating fiber tract information in lesion-deficit analyses. The enhanced analysis framework opens a new avenue for studying neural systems, with the potential to facilitate identification of both cortical sectors and fiber tracts critical for cognitive functioning.},

abstract = {The thickness of the cerebral cortex was measured in 106 non-demented participants ranging in age from 18 to 93 years. For each participant, multiple acquisitions of structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were averaged to yield high-resolution, high-contrast data sets. Cortical thickness was estimated as the distance between the gray/white boundary and the outer cortical surface, resulting in a continuous estimate across the cortical mantle. Global thinning was apparent by middle age. Men and women showed a similar degree of global thinning, and did not differ in mean thickness in the younger or older groups. Age-associated differences were widespread but demonstrated a patchwork of regional atrophy and sparing. Examination of subsets of the data from independent samples produced highly similar age-associated patterns of atrophy, suggesting that the specific anatomic patterns within the maps were reliable. Certain results, including prominent atrophy of prefrontal cortex and relative sparing of temporal and parahippocampal cortex, converged with previous findings. Other results were unexpected, such as the finding of prominent atrophy in frontal cortex near primary motor cortex and calcarine cortex near primary visual cortex. These findings demonstrate that cortical thinning occurs by middle age and spans widespread cortical regions that include primary as well as association cortex.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that altered cerebral white matter (WM) influences normal aging, and further that WM degeneration may modulate the clinical expression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we conducted a study of differences in WM volume across the adult age span and in AD employing a newly developed, automated method for regional parcellation of the subcortical WM that uses curvature landmarks and gray matter (GM)/WM surface boundary information. This procedure measures the volume of gyral WM, utilizing a distance constraint to limit the measurements from extending into the centrum semiovale. Regional estimates were first established to be reliable across two scan sessions in 20 young healthy individuals. Next, the method was applied to a large clinically-characterized sample of 299 individuals including 73 normal older adults and 91 age-matched participants with very mild to mild AD. The majority of measured regions showed a decline in volume with increasing age, with strong effects found in bilateral fusiform, lateral orbitofrontal, superior frontal, medial orbital frontal, inferior temporal, and middle temporal WM. The association between WM volume and age was quadratic in many regions suggesting that WM volume loss accelerates in advanced aging. A number of WM regions were further reduced in AD with parahippocampal, entorhinal, inferior parietal and rostral middle frontal WM showing the strongest AD-associated reductions. There were minimal sex effects after correction for intracranial volume, and there were associations between ventricular volume and regional WM volumes in the older adults and AD that were not apparent in the younger adults. Certain results, such as the loss of WM in the fusiform region with aging, were unexpected and provide novel insight into patterns of age associated neural and cognitive decline. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of automated regional WM measures in revealing the distinct patterns of age and AD associated volume loss that may contribute to cognitive decline.},

@article{Seibert2012,
abstract = {The pattern of interregional functional MRI correlations at rest is being actively considered as a potential noninvasive biomarker in multiple diseases. Before such methods can be used in clinical studies it is important to establish their usefulness in three ways. First, the long-term stability of resting correlation patterns should be characterized, but there have been very few such studies. Second, analysis of resting correlations should account for the unique neuroanatomy of each subject by taking measurements in native space and avoiding transformation of functional data to a standard volume space (e.g., Talairach-Tournox or Montreal Neurological Institute atlases). Transformation to a standard volume space has been shown to variably influence the measurement of functional correlations, and this is a particular concern in diseases which may cause structural changes in the brain. Third, comparisons within the patient population of interest and comparisons between patients and age-matched controls, should demonstrate sensitivity to any disease-related disruption of resting functional correlations. Here we examine the test-retest stability of resting fMRI correlations over a period of one year in a group of healthy adults and in a group of cognitively intact individuals who are gene-positive for Huntington's disease. A recently-developed method is used to measure functional correlations in the native space of individual subjects. The utility of resting functional correlations as a biomarker in premanifest Huntington's disease is also investigated. Results in control and premanifest Huntington's populations were both highly consistent at the group level over one year. We thus show that when resting fMRI analysis is performed in native space (to reduce confounds in registration between subjects and groups) it has good long-term stability at the group level. Individual-subject level results were less consistent between visit 1 and visit 2, suggesting further work is required before resting fMRI correlations can be useful diagnostically for individual patients. No significant effect of premanifest Huntington's disease on prespecified interregional fMRI correlations was observed relative to the control group using either baseline or longitudinal measures. Within the premanifest Huntington's group, though, there was evidence that decreased striatal functional correlations might be associated with disease severity, as gauged by estimated years to symptom onset or by striatal volume.},

abstract = {Geometric distortions and poor image resolution are well known shortcomings of single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI). Yet, due to the motion immunity of ss-EPI, it remains the most common sequence for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Moreover, both navigated DW interleaved EPI (iEPI) and parallel imaging (PI) methods, such as sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and generalized autocalibrating parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA), can improve the image quality in EPI. In this work, DW-EPI accelerated by PI is proposed as a self-calibrated and unnavigated form of interleaved acquisition. The PI calibration is performed on the b = 0 s/mm2 data and applied to each shot in the rest of the DW data set, followed by magnitude averaging. Central in this study is the comparison of GRAPPA and SENSE in the presence of off-resonances and motion. The results show that GRAPPA is more robust than SENSE against both off-resonance and motion-related artifacts. The SNR efficiency was also investigated, and it is shown that the SNR/scan time ratio is equally high for one- to three-shot high-resolution diffusion scans due to the shortened EPI readout train length. The image quality improvements without SNR efficiency loss, together with motion tolerance, make the GRAPPA-driven DW-EPI sequence clinically attractive.},

abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

@article{Smith2009,
abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z < 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

abstract = {There are two main methods of quantitative analysis in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies: manual region of interest (ROI) and automated voxel based. The purpose of this study is to compare the results of each of these methods applied to the same data set. Linear correlative analysis was performed for mean diffusivity (Trace/3 ADC) and for fractional anisotropy (FA) versus age within 8-12 years (N = 32) and within 21-27 years (N = 28), as well as a group comparison. SPM analysis identified more structures changing with age, partly due to the limited regions measured with ROI analysis. In general, ROI and voxel-based analysis methods produced comparable results for widespread reductions of Trace/3 ADC and increases of FA with age, particularly for group comparison. The discrepancies (i.e., missed regions) were likely related to problems of spatial normalization for SPM analysis, and masking localized changes by averaging all the voxels within a region of interest for ROI analysis. These two analysis methods for DTI offer complementary results, but neither one yields the complete story of neurodevelopment.},

abstract = {Myelin loss and axonal damage are both observed in white matter injuries. Each may have significant impact on the long-term disability of patients. Currently, there does not exist a noninvasive biological marker that enables differentiation between myelin and axonal injury. We describe herein the use of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to quantify the effect of dysmyelination on water directional diffusivities in brains of shiverer mice in vivo. The principal diffusion eigenvalues of eight axonal fiber tracts that can be identified with certainty on DTI maps were measured. The water diffusivity perpendicular to axonal fiber tracts, lambda(perpendicular), was significantly higher in shiverer mice compared with age-matched controls, reflecting the lack of myelin and the increased freedom of cross-fiber diffusion in white matter. The water diffusivity parallel to axonal fiber tracts, lambda(parallel), was not different, which is consistent with the presence of intact axons. It is clear that dysmyelination alone does not impact lambda(parallel). The presence of intact axons in the setting of incomplete myelination was confirmed by electron microscopy. Although further validation is still needed, our finding suggests that changes in lambda(perpendicular) and lambda(parallel) may potentially be used to differentiate myelin loss versus axonal injury.},

abstract = {Both axon and myelin degeneration have significant impact on the long-term disability of patients with white matter disorder. However, the clinical manifestations of the neurological dysfunction caused by white matter disorders are not sufficient to determine the origin of neurological deficits. A noninvasive biological marker capable of detecting and differentiating axon and myelin degeneration would be a significant addition to currently available tools. Directional diffusivities derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been previously proposed by this group as potential biological markers to detect and differentiate axon and myelin degeneration. To further test the hypothesis that axial (lambdaparallel) and radial (lambdaperpendicular) diffusivities reflect axon and myelin pathologies, respectively, the optic nerve was examined serially using DTI in a mouse model of retinal ischemia. A significant decrease of lambdaparallel, the putative DTI axonal marker, was observed 3 days after ischemia without concurrently detectable changes in lambdaperpendicular, the putative myelin marker. This result is consistent with histological findings of significant axonal degeneration with no detectable demyelination at 3 days after ischemia. The elevation of lambdaperpendicular observed 5 days after ischemia is consistent with histological findings of myelin degeneration at this time. These results support the hypothesis that lambdaparallel and lambdaperpendicular hold promise as specific markers of axonal and myelin injury, respectively, and, further, that the coexistence of axonal and myelin degeneration does not confound this utility.},

abstract = {Myelin damage, as seen in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases, impairs axonal conduction and can also be associated with axonal degeneration. Accurate assessments of these conditions may be highly beneficial in evaluating and selecting therapeutic strategies for patient management. Recently, an analytical approach examining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived parameters has been proposed to assess the extent of axonal damage, demyelination, or both. The current study uses the well-characterized cuprizone model of experimental demyelination and remyelination of corpus callosum in mouse brain to evaluate the ability of DTI parameters to detect the progression of myelin degeneration and regeneration. Our results demonstrate that the extent of increased radial diffusivity reflects the severity of demyelination in corpus callosum of mouse brain affected by cuprizone treatment. Subsequently, radial diffusivity decreases with the progression of remyelination. Furthermore, radial diffusivity changes were specific to the time course of changes in myelin integrity as distinct from axonal injury, which was detected by betaAPP immunostaining and shown to be most extensive prior to demyelination. Radial diffusivity offers a specific assessment of demyelination and remyelination, as distinct from acute axonal damage.},

@article{Squitieri2009,
abstract = {Searching brain and peripheral biomarkers is a requisite to cure Huntington's disease (HD). To search for markers indicating the rate of brain neurodegenerative changes in the various disease stages, we quantified changes in brain atrophy in subjects with HD. We analyzed the cross-sectional and longitudinal rate of brain atrophy, quantitatively measured by fully-automated multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, as fractional gray matter (GM, determining brain cortex volume), white matter (WM, measuring the volume of axonal fibers), and corresponding cerebral spinal fluid (CSF, a measure of global brain atrophy), in 94 gene-positive subjects with presymptomatic to advanced HD, and age-matched healthy controls. Each of the three brain compartments we studied (WM, GM, and CSF) had a diverse role and their time courses differed in the development of HD. GM volume decreased early in life. Its decrease was associated with decreased serum brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor and started even many years before onset symptoms, then decreased slowly in a nonlinear manner during the various symptomatic HD stages. WM volume loss also began in the presymptomatic stage of HD a few years before manifest symptoms appear, rapidly decreasing near to the zone-of-onset. Finally, the CSF volume increase began many years before age at onset. Its volume measured in presymptomatic subjects contributed to improve the CAG-based model of age at onset prediction. The progressive CSF increase depended on CAG mutation size and continued linearly until the last stages of HD, perhaps representing the best marker of progression rate and severity in HD (R(2)= 0.25, P < 0.0001).},

At 3-28 days after ischemia, ipsilateral ON and contralateral OT showed significant reduction in axial diffusivity (32-40\% and 21-29\% respectively) suggestive of axonal damage. Both ON and OT showed significant increase in radial diffusivity, 200-290\% and 58-65\% respectively, at 9-28 days suggestive of myelin damage. Immunohistochemistry of phosphorylated neurofilament (pNF) and myelin basic protein (MBP) was performed to assess axonal and myelin integrities validating the DTI findings. Both DTI and immunohistochemistry detected that transient retinal ischemia caused more severe damage to ON than to OT. The current results suggest that axial and radial diffusivities are capable of reflecting the severity of axonal and myelin damage in mice as assessed using immunohistochemistry.},

abstract = {Anisotropy of water diffusion in axon tracts, as determined by diffusion-weighted MRI, has been assumed to reflect the restriction of water diffusion across axon membranes. Reduction in this anisotropy has been interpreted as degeneration of axons. These interpretations are based primarily on a priori reasoning that has had little empirical validation. We used the experimental advantages of the sea lamprey spinal cord, which contains several very large axons, to determine whether intraaxonal diffusion is isotropic and whether anisotropy is attributable to restriction of water mobility by axon surface membranes. Through the application of magnetic resonance microimaging, we were able to measure the purely intraaxonal diffusion characteristics of the giant reticulospinal axons (20-40 microm in diameter). The intraaxonal apparent diffusion coefficients of water parallel (longitudinal ADC, l-ADC) and perpendicular (transverse ADC, t-ADC) to the long axis were 0.98 +/- 0.06 (10(-3) mm2 sec) and 0.97 +/- 0.11 (10(-3) mm2 sec), respectively. In white matter regions that included multiple axons, l-ADCs were almost identical regardless of axon density in the sampled axon tract. By comparison, t-ADCs were reduced and varied inversely with the number of axons (and thus axolemmas) in a fixed cross-sectional area. Thus, diffusion was found to be isotropic when measured entirely within a single axon and anisotropic when measured in regions that included multiple axons. These findings support the hypothesis that the cell membrane is the primary source of diffusion anisotropy in fiber tracts of the central nervous system.},

abstract = {The development of cortical gray matter, white matter (WM) volume, and WM microstructure in adolescence is beginning to be fairly well characterized by structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies. However, these aspects of brain development have rarely been investigated concurrently in the same sample and hence the relations between them are not understood. We delineated the age-related changes in cortical thickness, regional WM volume, and diffusion characteristics and investigated the relationships between these properties of brain development. One hundred and sixty-eight healthy participants aged 8-30 years underwent sMRI and DTI. The results showed regional age-related cortical thinning, WM volume increases, and changes in diffusion parameters. Cortical thickness was the most strongly age-related parameter. All classes of measures showed unique associations with age. The results indicate that cortical thinning in adolescence cannot be explained by WM maturation in underlying regions as measured by volumetry or DTI. Moderate associations between cortical thickness and both volume and diffusion parameters in underlying WM regions were also found, although the relationships were not strong. It is concluded that none of the measures are redundant and that the integration of the 3 will yield a more complete understanding of brain maturation.},

abstract = {Periventricular white matter injury (PWI) is a major form of brain injury observed in congenital hemiparesis. The aim of this study is to determine the usefulness of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fibre tracking in delineating the primary and secondary degenerative changes in cerebral white matter and deep grey matter in patients with spastic cerebral palsy due to PWI and to look for any possible reorganization of the axonal architecture. Five hemiparetic cerebral palsy patients (median age 14 years) with known PWI were prospectively studied with DTI of the brain at 1.5T and quantitatively compared with five age and sex matched controls. Fibre tracts for various corticofugal, thalamocortical and association tracts were generated and analysed for the DTI fibre count and for diffusion parameters. A region of interest based analysis was performed for the directionally averaged mean diffusivity (D(av)) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in various white matter locations in the brain and the brainstem and in the deep grey matter nuclei. Group statistics were performed for these parameters using Mann-Whitney U-test comparing the affected sides in patients with either side in controls and the unaffected side in hemiparetics. There was significant reduction in DTI fibre count on the lesional side involving corticospinal tract (CST), corticobulbar tract (CBT) and superior thalamic radiation in the patient group compared with controls. Also there was an increase in DTI fibre count in the unaffected side of the hemiparetic patients in CST and CBT, which reached statistical significance only in CBT. The corpus callosum, cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculus and middle cerebellar peduncle failed to show any significant change. ROI measurements on the primary site of white matter lesion and the thalamus revealed a significant increase in D(av) and decrease in FA, suggesting primary degeneration. The CST in the brainstem, the body of corpus callosum and the head of caudate and lentiform nuclei showed features of secondary degeneration on the affected side. The CST on the unaffected side of hemiparetics was found to have a significant decrease in D(av) and an increase in FA. Thus the degeneration of various motor and sensory pathways, as well as deep grey matter structures, appears to be important in determining the pathophysiological mechanisms in patients with congenital PWI. Also evidence suggesting the reorganization of sensorimotor tracts in the unaffected side of spastic hemiparetic patients was noted.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can resolve the white matter fiber orientation within a voxel provided that the fibers are strongly aligned. However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. Ma},

@article{Tustison2012,
abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design. Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps each subject's image to a representative template before performing statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference (SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size-an experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms that are less sensitive to this bias. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Measurement of striatal volume using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a marker of striatal degeneration in Huntington disease (HD). Recent evidence suggests that diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) may also detect striatal damage in HD. Here, we compared the sensitivities of volumetric MRI and DWI at distinguishing 10 patients with early symptomatic HD from 12 age-matched controls. Additionally, we assessed longitudinal changes in striatal volume and diffusivity in 8 of the HD patients over a 2-year period. At baseline, HD patients had significantly smaller volumes and significantly higher trace of the diffusion coefficient (Trace(D)) values of putamen and caudate than controls, but the volume differences were relatively larger than the Trace(D) differences. Putaminal and caudate volumes were outside the normal range in 9 of 10 HD patients, whereas Trace(D) values of putamen and caudate were abnormal in 8 and 6 of 10 HD subjects, respectively. During 2-year follow-up, there was significant volume loss of HD putamen (mean change: -8.0\%) and caudate (mean change: -12.7\%). By contrast, longitudinal Trace(D) changes of putamen (mean change: 4.0\%) and caudate (mean change: 3.8\%) did not reach statistical significance. Thus, volumetric MRI seems more sensitive to striatal degeneration in early symptomatic HD than DWI.},

@article{VanderWerf,
abstract = {In spite of the acknowledged role that the thalamus plays in declarative memory, details about the precise memory processes it is involved in and which are the structures of the thalamus that contribute to these processes remain unknown. An overview is presented of human clinical and animal experimental findings showing the involvement of the thalamus, at the level of white matter tracts and separate nuclei, in aspects of memory functioning. The region in the thalamus that contributes to declarative memory is the anterior and medial division, containing the anterior nuclei, the medial dorsal nucleus and the intralaminar and midline nuclei. A lesion to the anterior nuclei or their afferent white matter tract, the mammillothalamic tract, results in deficits of encoding of new stimuli. Lesions to the medial dorsal nucleus affect executive processes pertaining to declarative memory, such as the use of memory strategies for retrieval; damage to the intralaminar and midline nuclei results in decreased arousal and thus affects the declarative memory process. Based on anatomical and functional data, a theory is proposed of how the thalamus might play a role at different levels of declarative memory functioning. Firstly, the anterior and mediodorsal nucleus are involved in processing the contents of the stimuli for storage and recall. The anterior nuclei influence the selection of material to be stored and remembered, whereas the mediodorsal nucleus is involved in the coordination and selection of the strategies used to retrieve material. Secondly, the intralaminar and midline nuclei and specifically the lateral and ventral components, maintain a necessary state of the cortical regions involved in the ongoing memory processes. The two types of function subserved by these groups of thalamic nuclei, focussing on contents vs. state, need to work in parallel to mediate and allow memory functioning, respectively.},

The adequacy of these tools for linear image registration leads us to revisit non-linear registration and allows us to provide interesting theoretical roots to the different variants of Thirion's demons algorithm.

Recently, log- Euclidean approaches have contributed to promote the use of such com- putational anatomy tools by permitting simple computations of statis- tics on a rather large class of invertible spatial transformations. In this work, we propose a non-linear registration algorithm perfectly fit for log- Euclidean statistics on diffeomorphisms. Our algorithmworks completely in the log-domain, i.e. it uses a stationary velocity field. This implies that we guarantee the invertibility of the deformation and have access to the true inverse transformation. This also means that our output can be directly used for log-Euclidean statistics without relying on the heavy computation of the log of the spatial transformation. As it is often desir- able, our algorithm is symmetric with respect to the order of the input images. Furthermore, we use an alternate optimization approach related to Thirion’s demons algorithm to provide a fast non-linear registration algorithm. First results show that our algorithm outperforms both the demons algorithm and the recently proposed diffeomorphic demons algo- rithm in terms of accuracy of the transformation while remaining com- putationally efficient.},

abstract = {Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is being increasingly used to assess white matter integrity and it is therefore paramount to address the test-retest reliability of DTI measures. In this study we assessed inter- and intra-site reproducibility of two nominally identical 3T scanners at different sites in nine healthy controls using a DTI protocol representative of typical current "best practice" including cardiac gating, a multichannel head coil, parallel imaging and optimized diffusion gradient parameters. We calculated coefficients of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of fractional anisotropy (FA) measures for the whole brain, for three regions of interest (ROI) and for three tracts derived from these ROI by probabilistic tracking. We assessed the impact of affine, nonlinear and template based methods for spatially aligning FA maps on the reproducibility. The intra-site CV for FA ranged from 0.8\% to 3.0\% with ICC from 0.90 to 0.99, while the inter-site CV ranged from 1.0\% to 4.1\% with ICC of 0.82 to 0.99. Nonlinear image coregistration improved reproducibility compared to affine coregistration. Normalization to template space reduced the between-subject variation, resulting in lower ICC values and indicating a possibly reduced sensitivity. CV from probabilistic tractography were about 50\% higher than for the corresponding seed ROI. Reproducibility maps of the whole scan volume showed a low variation of less than 5\% in the major white matter tracts but higher variations of 10-15\% in gray matter regions. One of the two scanners showed better intra-site reproducibility, while the intra-site CV for both scanners was significantly better than inter-site CV. However, when using nonlinear coregistration of FA maps, the average inter-site CV was below 2\%. There was a consistent inter-site bias, FA values on site 2 were 1.0-1.5\% lower than on site 1. Correction for this bias with a global scaling factor reduced the inter-site CV to the range of intra-site CV. Our results are encouraging for multi-centre DTI studies in larger populations, but also illustrate the importance of the image processing pipeline for reproducibility.},

abstract = {The uncinate fasciculus is a bidirectional, long-range white matter tract that connects lateral orbitofrontal cortex and Brodmann area 10 with the anterior temporal lobes. Although abnormalities in the uncinate fasciculus have been associated with several psychiatric disorders and previous studies suggest it plays a putative role in episodic memory, language and social emotional processing, its exact function is not well understood. In this review we summarize what is currently known about the anatomy of the uncinate, we review its role in psychiatric and neurological illnesses, and we evaluate evidence related to its putative functions. We propose that an overarching role of the uncinate fasciculus is to allow temporal lobe-based mnemonic associations (e.g. an individual's name + face + voice) to modify behaviour through interactions with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, which provides valence-based biasing of decisions. The bidirectionality of the uncinate fasciculus information flow allows orbital frontal cortex-based reward and punishment history to rapidly modulate temporal lobe-based mnemonic representations. According to this view, disruption of the uncinate may cause problems in the expression of memory to guide decisions and in the acquisition of certain types of learning and memory. Moreover, uncinate perturbation should cause problems that extend beyond memory to include social-emotional problems owing to people and objects being stripped of personal value and emotional history and lacking in higher-level motivational value.},

abstract = {Two- and three-dimensional (3D) white matter atlases were created on the basis of high-spatial-resolution diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and 3D tract reconstruction. The 3D trajectories of 17 prominent white matter tracts could be reconstructed and depicted. Tracts were superimposed on coregistered anatomic MR images to parcel the white matter. These parcellation maps were then com- pared with coregistered diffusion tensor imaging color maps to assign visible struc- tures. The results showed (a) which anatomic structures can be identified on diffusion tensor images and (b) where these anatomic units are located at each section level and orientation. The atlas may prove useful for educational and clinical purposes.},

The protocols were refined by several iterations of intra- and inter-rater measurements and identification of sources of variability. Reproducibility of the established protocols was then tested by raters who did not have previous experience in tractography. The protocols were applied to a DTI database of adult normal subjects to study size, fractional anisotropy (FA), and T2 of individual white matter tracts. Distinctive features in FA and T2 were found for the corticospinal tract and callosal fibers. Hemispheric asymmetry was observed for the size of white matter tracts projecting to the temporal lobe.

@article{Wang2011,
abstract = {Summary Multiple sclerosis is characterized by inflammatory demyelination and irreversible axonal injury leading to permanent neurological disabilities. Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrates an improved capability over standard magnetic resonance imaging to differentiate axon from myelin pathologies. However, the increased cellularity and vasogenic oedema associated with inflammation cannot be detected or separated from axon/myelin injury by diffusion tensor imaging, limiting its clinical applications. A novel diffusion basis spectrum imaging, capable of characterizing water diffusion properties associated with axon/myelin injury and inflammation, was developed to quantitatively reveal white matter pathologies in central nervous system disorders. Tissue phantoms made of normal fixed mouse trigeminal nerves juxtaposed with and without gel were employed to demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion basis spectrum imaging to quantify baseline cellularity in the absence and presence of vasogenic oedema. Following the phantom studies, in vivo diffusion basis spectrum imaging and diffusion tensor imaging with immunohistochemistry validation were performed on the corpus callosum of cuprizone treated mice. Results demonstrate that in vivo diffusion basis spectrum imaging can effectively separate the confounding effects of increased cellularity and/or grey matter contamination, allowing successful detection of immunohistochemistry confirmed axonal injury and/or demyelination in middle and rostral corpus callosum that were missed by diffusion tensor imaging. In addition, diffusion basis spectrum imaging-derived cellularity strongly correlated with numbers of cell nuclei determined using immunohistochemistry. Our findings suggest that diffusion basis spectrum imaging has great potential to provide non-invasive biomarkers for neuroinflammation, axonal injury and demyelination coexisting in multiple sclerosis.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor tractography is increasingly used to examine structural connectivity in the brain in various conditions, but its test-retest reliability is understudied. The main purposes of this study were to evaluate 1) the reliability of quantitative measurements of diffusion tensor tractography and 2) the effect on reliability of the number of gradient sampling directions and scan repetition. Images were acquired from ten healthy participants. Ten fiber regions of nine major fiber tracts were reconstructed and quantified using six fiber variables. Intra- and inter-session reliabilities were estimated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV), and were compared to pinpoint major error sources. Additional pairwise comparisons were made between the reliability of images with 30 directions and NEX 2 (DTI30-2), 30 directions and NEX 1 (DTI30-1), and 15 directions and NEX 2 (DTI15-2) to determine whether increasing gradient directions and scan repetition improved reliability. Of the 60 tractography measurements, 43 showed intersession CV≤10\%, ICC≥.70, or both for DTI30-2, 40 measurements for DTI30-1, and 37 for DTI15-2. Most of the reliable measurements were associated with the tracts corpus callosum, cingulum, cerebral peduncular fibers, uncinate fasciculus, and arcuate fasciculus. These reliable measurements included factional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity of all 10 fiber regions. Intersession reliability was significantly worse than intra-session reliability for FA, mean length, and tract volume measurements from DTI15-2, indicating that the combination of MRI signal variation and physiological noise/change over time was the major error source for this sequence. Increasing the number of gradient directions from 15 to 30 while controlling the scan time, significantly affected values for all six variables and reduced intersession variability for mean length and tract volume measurements. Additionally, while increasing scan repetition from 1 to 2 had no significant effect on the reliability for DTI with 30 directions, this significantly reduced the upward bias in FA values from all 10 fiber regions and fiber count, mean length, and tract volume measurements from 5 to 7 fiber regions. In conclusion, diffusion tensor tractography provided many measurements with high test-retest reliability across different fiber variables and various fiber tracts even for images with 15 directions (NEX 2). Increasing the number of gradient directions from 15 to 30 with equivalent scan time reduced variability whereas increasing repetition from 1 to 2 for 30-direction DTI improved the accuracy of tractography measurements.},

@article{Wassermann2010,
abstract = {We present a novel technique for the tract-based statistical analysis of diffusion imaging data. In our technique, we represent each white matter (WM) tract as a tract probability map (TPM): a function mapping a point to its probability of belonging to the tract. We start by automatically clustering the tracts identified in the brain via tractography into TPMs using a novel Gaussian process framework. Then, each tract is modeled by the skeleton of its TPM, a medial representation with a tubular or sheet-like geometry. The appropriate geometry for each tract is implicitly inferred from the data instead of being selected a priori, as is done by current tract-specific approaches. The TPM representation makes it possible to average diffusion imaging based features along directions locally perpendicular to the skeleton of each WM tract, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of statistical analyses on the WM. Our framework therefore facilitates the automated analysis of WM tract bundles, and enables the quantification and visualization of tract-based statistical differences between groups. We have demonstrated the applicability of our framework by studying WM differences between 34 schizophrenia patients and 24 healthy controls.},

@article{Wassermann2010a,
abstract = {With the increasing importance of fiber tracking in diffusion tensor images for clinical needs, there has been a growing demand for an objective mathematical framework to perform quantitative analysis of white matter fiber bundles incorporating their underlying physical significance. This article presents such a novel mathematical framework that facilitates mathematical operations between tracts using an inner product between fibres. Such inner product operation, based on Gaussian processes, spans a metric space. This metric facilitates combination of fiber tracts, rendering operations like tract membership to a bundle or bundle similarity simple. Based on this framework, we have designed an automated unsupervised atlas-based clustering method that does not require manual initialization nor an a priori knowledge of the number of clusters. Quantitative analysis can now be performed on the clustered tract volumes across subjects, thereby avoiding the need for point parameterization of these fibers, or the use of medial or envelope representations as in previous work. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the mathematical operations. Subsequently, the applicability of the unsupervised clustering framework has been demonstrated on a 21-subject dataset.},

In the HD subjects, but not controls, a significant reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of WM integrity, between baseline and followup was evident throughout the brain. In addition, a DTI scalar associated with the stability of axons, axial diffusivity, showed significant longitudinal decreases from year 1 to year 2 in HD subjects, declines that overlapped to greater degree with FA discrepancies than longitudinal increases in radial diffusivity, a DTI variable sensitive to demylinization. These preliminary results provide the first longitudinal DTI evidence of WM degeneration in HD and support the notion that FA abnormalities in HD may be a result of axonal injury or withdrawal. These results suggest that longitudinal FA changes may serve as a neuropathological biomarker in HD.},

@article{Werner2013,
abstract = {Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Using resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) we investigated the functional integrity of resting-state networks (RSN) in HD. 17 HD and 19 matched control participants were examined at a 3 Tesla MR scanner. After controlling for structural degeneration by means of voxel-based morphometry, task-free rs-fMRI data were analyzed using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a dual-regression approach in the context of genetic and clinical parameters. Further, we evaluated HD-related differences in interregional connectivity between networks. RSN analysis showed a significant increase in intrinsic functional connectivity in the HD sample compared with controls, including the thalamus, striatum, prefrontal, premotor, and parietal maps. A subset of the Default Mode Network (DMN) was also affected. In the HD cohort, motor impairment correlated with higher network connectivity in mainly motor and parietal cortices. Deteriorating total functional capacity was additionally associated with higher connectivity in the striatum, thalamus, insular and frontal areas. This pattern of increased activity in intrinsic functional networks might suggest a reduced ability of intra-network differentiation with clinical disease progression in HD. Finally, results showed reduced long-range connectivity between parietal ICA components in HD compared to controls, indicating impaired functional coupling between interregional networks in HD. Our data demonstrates that functional connectivity is profoundly altered in HD, both within and between RSN. Rs-fMRI analysis may provide additional valuable insights into neuronal dysfunctions beyond HD-related structural degeneration and disruptions of functional circuits in HD.

@article{Zhang2011,
abstract = {The identification of clinical and biological markers of disease in persons at risk for Huntington disease (HD) has increased in efforts to better quantify and characterize the epoch of prodrome prior to clinical diagnosis. Such efforts are critical in the design and implementation of clinical trials for HD so that interventions can occur at a time most likely to increase neuronal survival and maximize daily functioning. A prime consideration in the examination of prodromal individuals is their proximity to diagnosis. It is necessary to quantify proximity so that individual differences in key marker variables can be properly interpreted. We take a data-driven approach to develop an index that can be viewed as a proxy for time to HD diagnosis known as the CAG-Age Product Scaled or CAP(S) . CAP(S) is an observed utility variable computed for all genetically at-risk individuals based on age at study entry and CAG repeat length. Results of a longitudinal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that CAP(S) had a relatively strong ability to predict individuals who became diagnosed, especially in the first 2 years. Bootstrap validation provided evidence that CAP(S) computed on a new sample from the same population could have similar discriminatory power. Cutoffs for the empirical CAP(S) distribution can be used to create a classification for mutation-positive individuals (Low-Med-High), which is, useful for comparison with the naturally occurring mutation-negative Control group. The classification is an improvement over the one currently in use as it is based on observed data rather than model-based estimated values. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
