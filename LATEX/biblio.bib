@article{Gomez-Tortosa2001,
abstract = {Morphometric studies of the tail of the caudate nucleus, the site where the pathology is first seen, were performed on 16 brain specimens collected from individuals at risk for inheriting Huntington's disease (HD). Medical records and information obtained from immediate family members indicated that all had died without symptoms of HD. Six individuals had 37 or more CAG repeats and were designated HD gene carriers, whereas 10 were determined to be non-carriers. Cell counts of the tail of the caudate nucleus revealed an increased density of oligodendrocytes among the presymptomatic HD gene carriers (mean cells/field: carriers = 40.0, noncarrier = 21.3; age, sex, repeated measure adjusted F[126] = 11.7, p = 0.0008). No statistically significant differences were found between HD carriers and noncarriers in the density of neurons (carriers = 16.9, noncarriers = 15.5), astrocytes (carriers = 27.8, noncarriers = 21.3) or microglial cells (carriers = 7.9, noncarriers = 5.6). Ubiquitin immunostaining performed in 3 gene carriers revealed intranuclear inclusions in all 3 cases, including 1, with 37 repeats, who died 3 decades before the expected age for onset of the clinical syndrome. Normal densities of other cell types and careful macroscopic examination suggest that the increase in oligodendroglial density is not a consequence of atrophy and may instead reflect a developmental effect of the HD gene.},

@article{Frank2010,
abstract = {There is inevitable physical, cognitive and behavioural decline in Hun- tington’s disease (HD), a dominantly inherited progressive neurological disorder. The hallmark of the disease is chorea, an involuntary brief move- ment that tends to flow between body regions.HDis diagnosed clinically with genetic confirmation. Predictive testing is available; however, it should be undertaken with caution in patients at risk for the disease but without clinical disease expression. Ongoing observational trials have identified not only early subtle motor signs, but also striatal volume, verbal memory and olfaction as possible early manifestations of clinical disease. Multiple areas of the brain degenerate, with dopamine, glutamate and GABA being the pre-dominant neurotransmitters affected in HD. Although many pharmaco- therapies have been evaluated targeting these neurotransmitters, few well conducted trials for symptomatic or neuroprotective interventions have yielded positive results. Tetrabenazine is one of the better studied and more effective agents for reducing chorea, although with a risk of potentially ser- ious adverse effects. Newer antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine and aripiprazolemayhave adequate efficacy with a more favourable adverse-effect profile than older antipsychotics for treating chorea and psychosis. In this review, the pathogenesis, epidemiology and diagnosis ofHDare discussed as background for understanding potential pharmacological treatment options. Potential strategies to delay the progression of HD that have been studied and are planned for the future are summarized. Although there is no current method to change the course of this devastating disease, education and symptomatic therapies are effective tools available to clinicians and the families affected by HD.},

abstract = {Quantitative-diffusion-tensor MRI consists of deriving and displaying parameters that resemble histological or physiological stains, i.e., that characterize intrinsic features of tissue microstructure and microdynamics. Specifically, these parameters are objective, and insensitive to the choice of laboratory coordinate system. Here, these two properties are used to derive intravoxel measures of diffusion isotropy and the degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as intervoxel measures of structural similarity, and fiber-tract organization from the effective diffusion tensor, D, which is estimated in each voxel. First, D is decomposed into its isotropic and anisotropic parts, [D] I and D - [D] I, respectively (where [D] = Trace(D)/3 is the mean diffusivity, and I is the identity tensor). Then, the tensor (dot) product operator is used to generate a family of new rotationally and translationally invariant quantities. Finally, maps of these quantitative parameters are produced from high-resolution diffusion tensor images (in which D is estimated in each voxel from a series of 2D-FT spin-echo diffusion-weighted images) in living cat brain. Due to the high inherent sensitivity of these parameters to changes in tissue architecture (i.e., macromolecular, cellular, tissue, and organ structure) and in its physiologic state, their potential applications include monitoring structural changes in development, aging, and disease.},

abstract = {There are two main methods of quantitative analysis in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies: manual region of interest (ROI) and automated voxel based. The purpose of this study is to compare the results of each of these methods applied to the same data set. Linear correlative analysis was performed for mean diffusivity (Trace/3 ADC) and for fractional anisotropy (FA) versus age within 8-12 years (N = 32) and within 21-27 years (N = 28), as well as a group comparison. SPM analysis identified more structures changing with age, partly due to the limited regions measured with ROI analysis. In general, ROI and voxel-based analysis methods produced comparable results for widespread reductions of Trace/3 ADC and increases of FA with age, particularly for group comparison. The discrepancies (i.e., missed regions) were likely related to problems of spatial normalization for SPM analysis, and masking localized changes by averaging all the voxels within a region of interest for ROI analysis. These two analysis methods for DTI offer complementary results, but neither one yields the complete story of neurodevelopment.},

@article{Ashburner2000,
abstract = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data.},

@article{Smith2006,
abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

abstract = {Although Huntington's disease is largely considered to be a subcortical disease, there is no clear consensus on whether all deep grey matter loss is a direct downstream consequence of the massive degeneration of the medium-size spiny neurons in the striatum. Our aim was to characterise in vivo such preferential degeneration by analysing various distinct diffusion imaging measures including mean diffusivity, anisotropy, fibre orientation (using the information of the principal diffusion direction) and white matter tractography. All results converged to demonstrate the selective degeneration of connections in subcortical grey and white matter, degeneration which was likely to originate with the death of the striatal medium-size spiny neurons. Indeed, we found a significant increase of MD and FA in all the subcortical grey matter structures involved in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. The atypical striatal and pallidal increase of FA was concurrent to a decrease of the dispersion of the fibre orientation, unambiguously characterising a preferential loss of connections along specific radiating directions from these structures while some others are comparatively spared. Analysis of striatal and pallidal white matter tracts revealed that striato-pallidal projections were the most affected. The ability of DTI to uncover the impact of such neurodegenerative disease on some specific neuronal/axonal populations is a further step towards the future definition of a surrogate marker of this disease. Beyond Huntington's disease, we prove here that diffusion imaging technique, associated to adequate methodological analyses, can provide insight into any neurodegenerative disorder for which some neuronal populations or connections are selectively targeted over others.},

abstract = {Serial diffusion tensor imaging scans were collected at baseline and 1 year follow-up to investigate the neurodegenerative profile of white matter (WM) in seven individuals with the Huntington's Disease (HD) gene mutation and seven control subjects matched on age and gender. In the HD subjects, but not controls, a significant reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of WM integrity, between baseline and followup was evident throughout the brain. In addition, a DTI scalar associated with the stability of axons, axial diffusivity, showed significant longitudinal decreases from year 1 to year 2 in HD subjects, declines that overlapped to greater degree with FA discrepancies than longitudinal increases in radial diffusivity, a DTI variable sensitive to demylinization. These preliminary results provide the first longitudinal DTI evidence of WM degeneration in HD and support the notion that FA abnormalities in HD may be a result of axonal injury or withdrawal. These results suggest that longitudinal FA changes may serve as a neuropathological biomarker in HD.},

abstract = {Atrophy of cortical and subcortical gray matter is apparent in Huntington's disease (HD) before symptoms manifest. We hypothesized that the white matter (WM) connecting cortical and subcortical regions must also be affected early and that select clinical symptoms were related to systems degeneration. We used diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) to examine the regional nature of WM abnormalities in early HD, including the preclinical period, and to determine whether regional changes correlated with clinical features. We studied individuals in early stages (HD), presymptomatic individuals known to carry the genetic mutation that causes HD (Pre-HD), and matched healthy controls. DTI indices of tissue integrity were obtained from several regions of interest, including the corpus callosum (CC), internal capsule (IC), and basal ganglia, were compared across groups by t tests, and were correlated to cognitive and clinical measures. WM alterations were found throughout the CC, in the anterior and posterior limbs of the IC, and in frontal subcortical WM in HD subjects, supporting the selective involvement of the pyramidal tracts in HD; a similar distribution of changes was seen in Pre-HD subjects, supporting presymptomatic alterations. There was a significant relationship between select DTI measures and cognitive performance. Alterations in diffusion indices were also seen in the striatum that were independent of atrophy. Our findings support that WM alterations occur very early in HD. The distribution of the changes suggests that these changes contribute to the disruption of pyramidal and extrapyramidal circuits and also support a role of compromised cortical circuitry in early cognitive and subtle motor impairment during the preclinical stages of HD.},

To investigate WM degeneration we used Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics to compare Fractional Anisotropy, Mean Diffusivity (MD), parallel diffusivity and perpendicular diffusivity ($\lambda$⊥) in WM throughout the whole brain in 17 clinically diagnosed HD patients and 16 matched controls. Significant WM diffusivity abnormalities were identified primarily in the corpus callosum (CC) and external/extreme capsules in HD patients compared to controls. Significant correlations were observed between motor symptoms and MD in the CC body, and between global cognitive impairment and $\lambda$⊥ in the CC genu. Probabilistic tractography from these regions revealed degeneration of functionally relevant interhemispheric WM tracts. Our findings suggest that WM degeneration within interhemispheric pathways plays an important role in the deterioration of cognitive and motor function in HD patients, and that improved understanding of WM pathology early in the disease is required.},

abstract = {Movement artifacts and other sources of noise are a matter of concern particularly in the neuroimaging research of movement disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD). Using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fractional anisotropy (FA) as a compound marker of white matter integrity, we investigated the effect of movement on HD specific changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and how post hoc compensation for it affects the MRI results. To this end, we studied by 3T MRI: 18 early affected, 22 premanifest gene-positive subjects, 23 healthy controls (50 slices of 2.3 mm thickness per volume, 64 diffusion-weighted directions (b = 1000 s/mm2), 8 minimal diffusion-weighting (b = 100 s/mm2)); and by 1.5 T imaging: 29 premanifest HD, 30 controls (40 axial slices of 2.3 mm thickness per volume, 61 diffusion-weighted directions (b = 1000 s/mm2), minimal diffusion-weighting (b = 100 s/mm2)). An outlier based method was developed to identify movement and other sources of noise by comparing the index DWI direction against a weighted average computed from all other directions of the same subject. No significant differences were observed when separately comparing each group of patients with and without removal of DWI volumes that contained artifacts. In line with previous DWI-based studies, decreased FA in the corpus callosum and increased FA around the basal ganglia were observed when premanifest mutation carriers and early affected patients were compared with healthy controls. These findings demonstrate the robustness of the FA value in the presence of movement and thus encourage multi-center imaging studies in HD.},

Thus, changes of the corpus callosum (CC) may reflect various aspects of HD pathogenesis. We recruited 17 HD patients, 17 pre-HD subjects, and 34 healthy age-matched controls. Three-dimensional anatomical MRI and diffusion tensor images of the brain were acquired on a 3T scanner. Combining region-of-interest analyses, voxel-based morphometry, and tract-based spatial statistics, we investigated callosal thickness, WM density, fractional anisotropy, and radial and axial diffusivities. Compared with controls, pre-HD subjects showed reductions of the isthmus, likely due to myelin damage. Compared with pre-HD subjects, HD patients showed reductions of isthmus and body, with axonal damage confined to the body. Compared with controls, HD patients had significantly decreased callosal measures in extended regions across almost the entire CC. At this disease stage, both myelin and axonal damage are detectable. Supplementary multiple regression analyses revealed that WM reduction density in the isthmus as well as Disease Burden scores allowed to predict the "HD development" index. While callosal changes seem to proceed in a posterior-to-anterior direction as the diseases progresses, this observation requires validation in future longitudinal investigations.},

@article{Dumas2012,
abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the function-structure relationship of white matter within different stages of Huntington's disease (HD) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Experimental design: From the TRACK-HD study, an early stage HD group and a premanifest gene carrier group (PMGC) were age-matched to two healthy control groups; all underwent 3-T MRI scanning of the brain. Region of interest (ROI) segmentation of the corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and sensorimotor cortex was applied, and the apparent fiber pathways of these regions were analyzed. Functional measures of motor, oculomotor, cognition, and behavior were correlated to DTI measures. Principle observations: In PMGC versus controls, higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was seen in white matter pathways of the sensorimotor cortex (P < 0.01) and in the ROI of corpus callosum (P < 0.017). In early HD, fiber tract analysis showed higher ADC in pathways of the corpus callosum, thalamus, sensorimotor, and prefrontal region (P < 0.01). ROI analysis showed higher diffusivity in the corpus callosum and caudate nucleus (P < 0.017). Motor, oculomotor, cognition, and probability of onset within 2 and 5 years, correlated well with ADC measures of the corpus callosum (P < 0.01 - P < 0.005), sensorimotor (P < 0.01 - P < 0.005), and prefrontal region (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Disturbances in the white matter connections of the sensorimotor cortex can be demonstrated not only in manifest HD but also in premanifest gene carriers. Connectivity measures are well related to clinical functioning. DTI measures can be regarded as a potential biomarker for HD, due to their ability to objectify changes in brain structures and their role within brain networks.

@article{Kim2014,
abstract = {Machine learning (ML)-based segmentation methods are a common technique in the medical image processing field. In spite of numerous research groups that have investigated ML-based segmentation frameworks, there remains unanswered aspects of performance variability for the choice of two key components: ML algorithm and intensity normalization. This investigation reveals that the choice of those elements plays a major part in determining segmentation accuracy and generalizability. The approach we have used in this study aims to evaluate relative benefits of the two elements within a subcortical MRI segmentation framework. Experiments were conducted to contrast eight machine-learning algorithm configurations and 11 normalization strategies for our brain MR segmentation framework. For the intensity normalization, a Stable Atlas-based Mapped Prior (STAMP) was utilized to take better account of contrast along boundaries of structures. Comparing eight machine learning algorithms on down-sampled segmentation MR data, it was obvious that a significant improvement was obtained using ensemble-based ML algorithms (i.e., random forest) or ANN algorithms. Further investigation between these two algorithms also revealed that the random forest results provided exceptionally good agreement with manual delineations by experts. Additional experiments showed that the effect of STAMP-based intensity normalization also improved the robustness of segmentation for multicenter data sets. The constructed framework obtained good multicenter reliability and was successfully applied on a large multicenter MR data set (n>. 3000). Less than 10{\%} of automated segmentations were recommended for minimal expert intervention. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using the ML-based segmentation tools for processing large amount of multicenter MR images. We demonstrated dramatically different result profiles in segmentation accuracy according to the choice of ML algorithm and intensity normalization chosen. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},
